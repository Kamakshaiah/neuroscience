Design/methodology/approach: The authors first take stock of research on reality-enhanced service communication with AR and VR, then complement these insights with emerging neuroscientific research to conceptualize how NeR enables innovative forms of service communication. On this basis, the authors develop a research agenda to guide the future study and managerial exploitation of NeR. Findings: AR and VR already offer unique affordances for digital-to-physical communication, but these can be extended with NeR. Specifically, NeR supports neuro-to-digital and digital-to-neuro communication based on neuroimaging (e.g. controlling digital content through thought) and neurostimulation (e.g. eliciting brain responses based on digital content). This provides a basis for outlining possible applications of NeR across service settings. Originality/value: The authors advance knowledge on reality-enhanced service communication with AR and VR, whilst also demonstrating how neuroscientific research can be extended from understanding brain activity to generating novel service interactions. © 2022, Tim Hilken, Mathew Chylinski, Ko de Ruyter, Jonas Heller and Debbie Isobel Keeling.",Augmented reality; Neuro-enhanced reality; Neuromarketing; Service communication; Virtual reality

Steady-state visual evoked potentials are evoked by a flashing light. Higher frequencies (above 30 Hz), preferred for safety and comfort, cannot be reliably generated on a standard computer display. In this paper, we present and verify a complete solution, based upon a previously proposed proof of concept, which allows for highlighting an arbitrary area of the screen by LEDs flickering at strictly controlled frequencies. To validate the proposed solution in the original context of non-muscular communication, we extended our previous, general study on “brain-computer interfaces illiteracy” to include 49 subjects, which resulted in a second-largest study of high frequency steady-state visual evoked potential-based brain-computer interface. In relation to the available literature on this topic, briefly reviewed in this paper, the presented results are the most promising in terms of combined percent of successful communication among users, accuracy and the significance of estimates. It suggests that the proposed approach and device are ready for applications, opening new possibilities not only in ergonomic design of brain-computer interfaces, but also in related fields like psychophysiological or neuromarketing research involving attention control, by tracing user's attention assigned to an arbitrary area of the screen. © 2021 Polish Academy of Sciences.

Methodology: The authors first reviewed the roots and definition of consumer neuroscience. Then, the authors outlined the main characteristics of the most commonly used neurophysiological tools (namely, skin conductance, facial electromyography, electrocardiogram, eye-tracking, electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, magnetoencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation) with a special emphasis on their advantages and weaknesses. Finally, the authors propose the development of research lines that could be implemented by marketing researchers with an appropriate application and understanding of tools and theories of neuroscience and psychology. Findings: The authors propose research questions to be addressed within four thematic areas: opportunities in product decisions (predicting product purchasing decisions, consumer responses to branding efforts and packaging), pricing, communication and retailing scenarios. The authors also incorporate insights into the complementarity of neurophysiological tools to traditional ones and situations in which these tools are useful for enhancing marketing theory. The authors finally shed light on the moral–ethical criticisms of this new branch of marketing.

However, constantly and swiftly changing the customers’ interests and consumption behaviors make it inevitable to utilize sophisticated tools and approaches based on advanced technologies. Among them, by measuring the customers’ physiological and neural signals, studying the customers’ cognitive and affective responses to marketing stimuli, neuromarketing provides deep insight into the customers’ motivations, preferences, and decisions. Recently, the internet of everything (IoE) has brought many new opportunities to the industry and has attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years. The main objective of this paper is to address how the IoE would empower neuromarketing techniques. Hence, an in-depth understanding of current research issues as well as emerging trends would help meet this goal. In this paper, a comprehensive review has been done by reviewing numerous journal and conference papers from various academic databases (sciencedirect.com, IEEE Xplore, Springer, Elsevier, Wiley, ACM digital library) based on applying various filtrations on specific keywords to identify and categorize the IoE devices in the neuromarketing field. In particular, we discussed the importance and the applications of IoE gadgets and devices, especially wearable medical technologies in eight neuromarketing techniques. Finally, we described critical existing challenges and limitations in neuromarketing and IoE gadgets that researchers have dealt with in this field of research. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Consumer neuroscience; Customers behavior; Digital marketing; Internet of things; Neuromarketing

In addition, this perception can be affected by the opinions of other users published on social networks. Researchers must set new goals to better understand user behavior through the information they have at their fingertips, and which influences them. The application of neuromarketing and artificial intelligence techniques to packaging has recently gained considerable popularity both, in academia and practice. With the combination of these methodologies, this study explores how people process and communicate healthy food products, and how people’s thoughts and behaviors are informative to other users when it comes to understanding their consumption patterns. Two studies have been carried out. The first one with an eye-tracking technique, in which the attention of 20 participants has been analyzed through first fixation and fixation duration metrics. The second study is based on 448 comments from users who have posted on the social network Instagram. The results obtained show, on the one hand, that healthy statements in food packaging attract unconscious attention, and on the other hand, that healthy claims on food packaging are not enough to achieve consumer satisfaction after purchasing the products.

Neuro-tourism provides accurate real-time data on tourists’ conscious and unconscious emotions. Neuro-tourism uses the methods of neuromarketing such as brain–computer interface (BCI), eye-tracking, galvanic skin response, etc., to create tourism goods and services to improve tourist experience and satisfaction. Due to the novelty of neuro-tourism and the dearth of studies on this subject, this study offered a comprehensive analysis of the peer-reviewed journal publications in neuro-tourism research for the previous 12 years to detect trends in this field and provide insights for academics. We reviewed 52 articles indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection database and examined them using our suggested classification schema. The results reveal a large growth in the number of published articles on neuro-tourism, demonstrating a rise in the relevance of this field. Additionally, the findings indicated a lack of integrating artificial intelligence techniques in neuro-tourism studies.

This helps evaluate the marketing stimuli which is traditionally done using marketing research procedures. BCI-based neuromarketing promises to replace these traditional marketing research procedures which are time-consuming and costly. Although BCI-based neuromarketing has its difficulty as EEG devices are inconvenient for consumer-grade applications. This study is performed to predict consumers' affective attitude (AA) and purchase intention (PI) toward a product using EEG signals. EEG signals are collected using a single channel consumer-grade EEG device from 4 healthy participants while they are subject to 3 different types of marketing stimuli; product, promotion, and endorsement. Multi-domain features are extracted from the EEG signals after pre-processing. 52 features are selected among those using SVM-based Recursive Feature Elimination. SMOTE algorithm is used to balance out the dataset. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify positive and negative affective attitude and purchase intention. The model manages to achieve an accuracy of 88.2% for affective attitude and 80.4% for purchase intention proving the viability of consumer-grade BCI devices in neuromarketing.  © 2022 IEEE.",Brain Computer Interface; EEG; Machine Learning; Neuromarketing; Signal Processing

This study aimed to use neurogastronomy and neuromarketing tools to study consumers' emotions and visual preferences toward native and classic potato flakes (Solanum tuberosum). Two types of fried flakes were used, classic potato and native potato, with a cost of S/ 6.60 (1.79 USD) and S/ 7.00 (1.90 USD), respectively. Eye Tracking technology and Emotion Analysis were used in the first stage using a mobile phone application. In the second stage, each participant answered a cognitive survey, using the Google form. A hundred consumers aged between 14 and 63 years were used. The survey showed that 45% of consumers indicated their intention to buy the native product rather than the classic product. The neuromarketing results mainly showed a higher proportion of neutrality, and a little lower, in negative emotions of ""skepticism"", ""sadness"" and ""disgust"", especially on the nutritional factor and price. These results, more than contradictory, are complementary since technological tools allow us to know more details about preferences and choices.

Mockup Development in software engineering leads to the creation of a prototype that is close to being the real implementation and is used for getting feedback on the final implementation. In spite of neuromarketing giving effective marketing results, enterprises restrict the usage of such research in their marketing activities, thus resulting in the under usage of this technique. Mockup creation is a time-consuming process, being complicated for consumers to understand design concepts within a few seconds, thus becoming difficult to design a perfect consumer-preferred website. This paper proposes an idea that helps in designing mockups with the help of neuroscience and leads to a reduction in time consumed by giving the accurate design to build a website. This novel idea focuses upon using neuroscience which gives the exact consumer reaction for mockups that are used as design tools virtually everywhere a new product is designed. The usage of Neuroscience in mockup development leads to the creation of exact and accurate mockups at a much faster rate leading to heavy cost savings for any software development organization.  © 2021 IEEE.",Design Thinking; Mockups; Neuromarketing; Prototype; Software Development; User Experience; User Interface

Therefore, it enables congregating consumer information and anticipating its preferences. Unlike classical marketing techniques, for instance, interviews with consumers, in which they usually do not communicate their real preferences, biomedical methodologies provide more powerful tools such as electroencephalogram signals and brain imaging, to explore the activity within the brain and examine its miscellaneous responses, which contribute efficiently to understanding human behavior related to its purchasing decision-making. Aiming to highlight the impact of neuroscience on marketing advancement, we first present in this paper a thoughtful background based on state-of-the-art studies to investigate the rate of several neurology techniques' contribution to the advancement of the marketing field and their effect on purchasing decision-making. Second, we propose a predictive modeling framework based on the analysis of EEG signals recorded during decision-making in terms of ""like""or ""dislike""of specific consumer products. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and kNN classifier were combined to develop such an automated model. For evaluation purposes, the developed model was performed on a well-known and public EEG dataset collected for marketing studies. Achieving promising results confirms that the developed framework can be used as a reliable tool for market strategy development.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte Ltd.

These techniques have been widely and positively applied in assessing customer experience (CX); however, little is known about their simultaneous application in the field of UX. As a specific context, the experience raised by different websites from two well-known automotive brands was compared. About 160 Italian university students were enrolled in an online experimental study. Participants performed a Brand Association Reaction Time Test (BARTT) version of the IAT where the two brands were compared according to different semantic dimensions already used in the automotive field. After completing the BARTT test, the participants navigated the target website: 80 participants navigated the first brand website, while the other half navigated the second brand website (between-subject design). During the first 3 min of website navigation, emotional facial expressions were recorded. The participants were asked to freely navigate the website home page, look for a car model and its characteristics and price, use the customising tool, and in the end, look for assistance. After the website navigation, all the participants performed, a second time, the BARTT version of the IAT, where the two brands were compared again, this time to assess whether the website navigation may impact the Implicit Associations previously detected. A traditional evaluation of the two websites was carried on by means of the classic heuristic evaluation. Findings from this study show, first of all, the significant results provided by neuromarketing techniques in the field of UX, as IAT can provide a positive application for assessing UX played by brand websites, thanks to the comparison of eventual changes in time reaction between the test performed before and after website navigation exposure. Secondly, results from emotional facial expression analyses during the navigation of both brand websites showed significant differences between the two brands, allowing the researchers to predict the emotional impact raised by each website. Finally, the positive correlation with heuristic evaluation shows that neuromarketing can be successfully applied in UX. © Copyright © 2021 Mauri, Rancati, Gaggioli and Riva.",brand association; emotions; facial expression; online experiment; user experience (UX)

Consumer’s preference prediction based on electroencephalography (EEG) can reliably predict likes or dislikes of a product. However, the current EEG prediction and classification accuracy have yet to reach ideal level. In addition, it is still unclear how different brain region information and different features such as power spectral density, brain asymmetry, differential entropy, and Hjorth parameters affect the prediction accuracy. Our study shows that by taking footwear products as an example, the recognition accuracy of product likes or dislikes reaches 94.22%. Compared with other brain regions, the features of the frontal and occipital brain region obtained a higher prediction accuracy, but the fusion of the features of the whole brain region could improve the prediction accuracy of likes or dislikes even further. Future work would be done to correlate the EEG-based like or dislike prediction results with product sales and self-reports.

Numerous studies have shown that it can also be applied to neuromarketing to assist customers in making decisions. By identifying the P300 component of the event-related potentials (ERPs), it can be known whether the target commodity or target stimuli is interesting to the consumer. However, when the target stimuli appear more frequently and people's responses to stimuli vary, it is challenging to locate the target stimuli based on the P300 in practical applications. Moreover, a significant P300 component can only be obtained by stacking and averaging multiple ERPs in normal conditions. In this study, we propose a group electroencephalogram processing method to estimate the timing of evoked stimulus appearance without compromising real-time performance using convolutional neural networks. In addition, this method can be used to estimate the group's attention to the target and standard stimulus. The results show that the effectiveness of the proposed processing method for stimuli presentation time estimation and group attention state estimation are 87.10 % and 96.55 %, respectively.  © 2022 IEEE.",Collective Simultaneous Measurement; Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Deep Learning; P300

There has also been an upsurge in utilizing digital solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic to address the unmet mental healthcare needs, especially for those unable to afford in-person office-based therapy sessions or those living in remote rural areas with limited access to mental healthcare providers. Despite these benefits, there are significant concerns regarding the widespread use of such technologies in the healthcare system. A few of those concerns are a potential breach in the patients' privacy, confidentiality, and the agency of patients being at risk of getting used for marketing or data harnessing purposes. Digital phenotyping aims to detect and categorize an individual's behavior, activities, interests, and psychological features to properly customize future communications or mental care for that individual. Neuromarketing seeks to investigate an individual's neuronal response(s) (cortical and subcortical autonomic) characteristics and uses this data to direct the person into purchasing merchandise of interest, or shaping individual's opinion in consumer, social or political decision making, etc. This commentary's primary concern is the intersection of these two concepts that would be an inevitable threat, more so, in the post-COVID era when disparities would be exaggerated globally. We also addressed the potential “dark web” applications in this intersection, worsening the crisis. We intend to raise attention toward this new threat, as the impacts might be more damming in low-income settings or/with vulnerable populations. Legal, health ethics, and government regulatory processes looking at broader impacts of digital marketing need to be in place. © Copyright © 2021 Akbarialiabad, Bastani, Taghrir, Paydar, Ghahramani and Kumar.",data privacy; digital mental health regulations; digital neuromarketing; digital phenotyping; global mental health; lower and middle income counteries

As such, it studies the neural activity associated with preference and purchase intent. Neuromarketing is considered an emerging area of research, driven in part by the approximately 400 billion dollars spent annually on advertisement and promotion. Given the size of this market, even a slight improvement in performance can have an immense impact. Traditional approaches to marketing consider a posteriori user feedback in the form of questionnaires, product ratings, or review comments, but these approaches do not fully capture or explain the real-time decision-making process of consumers. Various physiological measurement techniques have been proposed to facilitate the recording of this crucial aspect of the decision-making process, including brain imaging techniques [functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), steady state topography (SST)], and various biometric sensors. The use of EEG in neuromarketing is especially promising. EEG detects the sequential changes of brain activity, without appreciable time delay, needed to assess both the unconscious reaction and sensory reaction of the customer. Several types of EEG devices are now available in the market, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Researchers have conducted experiments using many of these devices, across different age groups and different categories of products. Because of the deep insights that can be gained, the field of neuromarketing research is carefully monitored by consumer and research protection groups to ensure that subjects are properly protected. This article surveys a range of considerations for EEG-based neuromarketing strategies, including the types of information that can be gathered, how marketing stimuli are presented to consumers, how such strategies may affect the consumer in terms of appeal and memory, machine learning techniques applied in the field, and the variety of challenges faced, including ethics, in this emerging field. © 2016 IEEE.",E-commerce; electroencephalography (EEG); neuromarketing; neuroscience

This new scenario challenges marketers with unique hurdles in both the commercialization of products and in managing information cues derived via VR retailing. Therefore, this study examined consumers’ impulsive behavior and unplanned purchases in a virtual retail store, using self-reports and electroencephalography. Borrowing assorted perspectives from retailing, virtual reality, and neuromarketing literature, we extended the stimulus-organism-response framework to evaluate how unplanned behavior evolves through conscious and unconscious measures. We found that consumers’ impulsiveness was significantly associated with their unplanned expenditure and the number of unplanned purchases. Using mediation analysis, we observed that flow experience during shopping partially mediated the relationship between the sense of presence and the desire to stay longer in a virtual shopping store. Desire to stay in the virtual store positively influenced store satisfaction, basket-size deviation, and budget deviation. Additionally, cognitive workload obtained via electroencephalogram revealed significant differences during both planned and unplanned purchases. These findings provide fresh opportunities for retailers to leverage the disruptive potential of immersive and interactive virtual technology to transform consumer shopping experiences. © 2023 The Authors",Cognitive load; Electroencephalogram; Impulse buying; Unplanned purchase; Virtual reality

The EEG montage assigned according to brain-region-specific localization draws out the subjects' true elicited subconscious response regardless of whether the subject attempts to control his/her affective state. The results showed the activation of theta and delta bands of EEG signals during the given stimuli. These elicited signal variations can be used to identify the best favoured item for successful product dispatch and reduction in loss.

One of these stimuli is color. In particular, our purchasing decisions are guided by individual color preferences. Color preferences influence various daily tasks. For example, people make decisions within 90 s of their first interaction with products, and approximately 60-90% of the evaluation of a product is based solely on its color properties. However, these types of behavior often escape consumer awareness, so marketing may need the help of neuroscience. Thus, it is necessary to place color preferences at the center of marketing strategies. However, few attempts have been made to unify the literature on the contribution of different color characteristics and the role of consumer characteristics.

At the same time, the basic methodological principle of neuromarketing is limited rationality in the context of behavioral and informational uncertainty. Purpose of publication - carrying out theoretical and methodological analysis of neuromarketing as a complex interdisciplinary and innovative area; disclosure of methodological principles and theoretical provisions of behavioral economics in the context of their applications in touch marketing. Such methods as analysis, comparison, generalization, systemic and logical ones were used in the research. It is argued that consumer decision-making in choice situations is influenced by emotions based on subconscious perception. It is proved that visual, sound and aromarketing are the main ""nudging"" factors of R. Thaler's theory in the context of neuromarketing. For the first time in the scientific discourse, the elements of the sensory component of neuromarketing are considered as stimulating factors for the implicit ""nudging"" of R. Thaler's behavioral economics theory. The theoretical and methodological foundations of neuromarketing research, which based on more realistic postulates of limited rationality, influence of emotions and information incompleteness in contrast to ""homo economicus"" neoclassical paradigm are improved. It is shown that a necessary condition for further successful development of neuromarketing is a combined interaction of psychology behavioral direction, neurophysiological technologies and empirical experience of marketers due to possible achievement of synergistic effect. The results of experimental studies, based on the empirical experience of a number of well-known scientists using neurophysiological methods, have proved the verification of the basic theoretical and methodological positions and individual effects of behavioral economics, which are actively used by Ukrainian marketers and marketers of other countries. © 2021 Ascociacion Internacional de Economia Aplicada.",Behavioral economics; Consumer; Economy; Emotions; Sensory marketing

Neuromarketing is comparatively new as a technique for designing marketing strategies, especially advertising campaigns. Marketers have used a variety of different neuromarketing tools, for instance functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), eye tracking, electroencephalography (EEG), steady-state probe topography (SSPT), and other expensive gadgets. Similarly, researchers have been using these devices to carry out their studies. Therefore, neuromarketing has been an expensive project for both companies and researchers. We employed 585 human responses and used the neural network (artificial intelligence) technique to examine the predictive consumer buying behavior of an effective advertisement. For this purpose, we employed two neural network applications (artificial intelligence) to examine consumer buying behavior, first taken from a 1–5 Likert scale. A second application was run to examine the predicted consumer buying behavior in light of the neuromarketing phenomenon. The findings suggest that a neural network (artificial intelligence) is a unique, cost-effective, and powerful alternative to traditional neuromarketing tools.

Now, after more than a decade, the marketing approach to other disciplines has led to advances in the field for a better understanding of consumer insights. Technological advances in fields such as neuroscience have facilitated investigations of consumer decision-making processes in real-world settings. In 2004, Camerer, Loewenstein and Prelec wrote about to bring neuroscience techniques and knowledge to bear on economic analysis (Camerer, Loewenstein and Prelec, 2004). The hope at that point in time was that the new functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMri) technique would allow researchers to identify which regions of the human brain are involved in different types of decisions and that activity in those regions would definitively reveal people's thoughts (Konovalov and Krajbich, 2019). Attempting to link both disciplines - economics and neuroscience - becomes evident that they have to learn a lot from each other (Bechara and Damasio, 2005; Smith et al., 2002). From this perspective, neuroeconomics is defined as applying neuroscientific methods to analyse and understand economically relevant behaviour (Camerer et al., 2004). Later, the discipline evolved by applying this methodology to other market issues. Thanks to the technological progress and the development of innovative solutions applied to neuroimaging, such as less invasive and wearable devices, the neuroscientific approach became a powerful tool to investigate unconscious reactions and the brain functioning during daily life (Borghini et al., 2019; Di Flumeri et al., 2019). Applied to marketing research, the term neuromarketing describes a field of study defined as applying neuroscientific methods to analyse and understand human behaviour concerning markets and marketing exchanges (Lee, Broderick and Chamberlain, 2007). This new paradigm in the management market with a centrality of the consumer insights through neuroscience techniques is currently applied in each marketing area such as communication, product, packaging, brand, retail, and pricing (please see Cherubino et al., 2019 for a review of provided insights from each marketing area). Within the discipline, there has been an evolution regarding the application areas. In recent years, researchers have focused their attention on applying the neuroscientific methods in product development, not only to the extrinsic features (i.e., packaging, price, shape, colour, and texture) but also to their intrinsic values (i.e., aroma, flavour). Framing these pieces of evidence with the current consumer-style - increasingly informed and interested in a healthy lifestyle without giving up the pleasure of taste -, seems of crucial interest to evolve in the application mentioned above of measuring experiences within the Food and Beverage (F&B) sector. This research aims to deepen the use of neuroscientific technologies in market research, focusing on neuroscience's contribution to the marketing management discipline and F&B marketers. The advantages and the pitfall of using neuroscience in the marketing applications will be discussed, and insights provided by consumer neurophysiological responses during different products' consumption experiences will be presented. © 2021 Societa Editrice Il Mulino.

Although the field has generated a diverse body of knowledge, we still find a dearth of studies classifying the existing literature into research themes and further presenting known and unknown aspects of Neuromarketing from a business and management viewpoint. To bridge this gap, the present study conducted a systematic literature review of Neuromarketing from 2011 to 2021, with a sample of 100 peer-reviewed articles. Based on rigorous review and thematic analysis of 41 relevant research articles, four research themes were identified – 1) Phenomenon, 2) Application, 3) Bright side, and 4) Dark side of Neuromarketing. Further, a theoretical framework of neuromarketing effect on consumer behaviour was presented.

A semi-structured interview with 16 academicians was conducted. The findings revealed that several issues had impeded the growth of neuromarketing, such as ethical and manipulation concerns, the high cost, the need for specialized expertise, lack of proper knowledge and understanding, the lack of financial resources, the lack of labs and facilities, and time requirements. Despite these obstacles, the academicians suggested several potential solutions to enhance the application of neuromarketing, such as establishing strong collaborative networks, providing labs and facilities, increasing financial resources, complying with laws and regulations, and reducing tools and experiment costs. This study will significantly contribute to the body of knowledge by increasing awareness of the potential difficulties in implementing neuromarketing techniques and helping to guide future research and development. This information can inform decision making by practitioners, researchers, and stakeholders, allowing them to make more informed decisions about using and implementing neuromarketing. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no current study has identified avenues for future research in neuromarketing and the emerging challenges and limitations that researchers may face in Malaysia. The current paper aims to foster the application of neuromarketing by providing potential solutions to overcome the obstacles researchers face.

Beyond that target, there are often other products displayed on the page, such as those suggested by the retailers’ recommendation systems, that can influence consumers’ buying behavior. We propose that display items that come from the same category as the target product (matched) may enhance target purchase by increasing the attractiveness of the presented opportunity. Contrasting this, mismatched display items may reduce purchase by raising awareness of opportunity costs. Eye-tracking was used to explore this framework by examining how different types of displays influenced visual attention. Although target purchase rates were higher for products with matched vs. mismatched displays, there was no difference in fixation time for the target images. However, participants attended to mismatched display items for more time than they did for matched ones consistent with the hypothesized processes. In addition, increases in display attractiveness increased target purchase, but only for matched items, in line with supporting the target category. Given the importance of relative attention and information in determining the impact of display items, we replicated the overall purchase effect across varying amounts of available display information in a second behavioral study. This demonstration of robustness supports the translational relevance of these findings for application in industry. © Copyright © 2021 Karmarkar, Carroll, Burke and Hijikata.",attention; choice-behavior; consumer neuroscience; decision making; e-commerce; eyetracking; neuromarketing; retail

We address this gap by simultaneously eliciting multiple neurophysiological measures: inter-beat interval from heart rate, skin conductance response, and frontal alpha asymmetry from electroencephalography (EEG) across multiple stimulus categories, and associating them with distinct psychological (emotional valence and arousal) and marketing (ad recognition and ad effectiveness) outcomes. We found that inter-beat interval was associated with emotional valence while skin conductance response was associated with emotional arousal across all stimulus types. Critically, self-reported arousal and inter-beat interval at both the aggregate and frame level were associated with ad recognition, but self-reported valence was not. Finally, inter-beat interval and frontal alpha asymmetry played complementary roles in predicting out-of-sample ad effectiveness. Specifically, while inter-beat interval was a significant predictor of out-of-sample brand recognition and not purchase intention, frontal alpha asymmetry was associated with purchase intention and not brand recognition components of ad effectiveness. Our results demonstrate distinct and complementary marketing applications for inter-beat interval, skin conductance response, and frontal alpha asymmetry and provide valuable insights to practitioners seeking to incorporate findings from these neurophysiological methodologies into their marketing decisions. © 2022 The Authors.

One of its uses in neuromarketing is to evaluate the response of marketing products based on an analysis of brain activity through an Electroencephalogram (EEG). Neuropsychology captures EEG variables such as emotion, attention, and enjoyment. It is one or a combination. Using multi variables is an advantage in representing more comprehensive neuromarketing assessments. Each variable has its characteristics, and using multi variables separately needs multi networks or separate networks. This paper proposed multiple networks. Each variable EEG signal is filtered using Wavelet according to the frequency band that characterizes it. Then, EEG signals from multiple channels were extracted using two-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (2D-CNN) as spatial directions, then identified using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) as temporal. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is one technique to arrange memory in RNN applications. We call the proposed method multiple hybrid 2D CNN-GRU. Experiments prove that the use of multiple networks outperformed single networks. In addition, it is seen that 2D-CNN performs better than 1D-CNN in spatial extraction. The choice of learning weight correction technique also affects performance, so the proposed method provided an accuracy of 91.7% and a Loss value of 0.2807.  © 2022 IEEE.",2D-CNN; attention; emotion; GRU; neuropsychology

As neuromarketing helps with effective advertising, brand creation, and product design. Conventional marketing techniques (e.g. newspaper publishing and television commercials) are sometimes ineffective in selling products, as these techniques do not strongly inspire customers to purchase certain products. Such traditional marketing techniques seek to assess the customer's tendency towards a product, which may not necessarily imply an attitude towards the brand and its purchase intentions. It is possible that the seller misinterprets the behaviour of the customer, since the expected behaviour does not always reflect the actual purchase behaviour of the customer. The book chapter focuses on linking the gap between neuromarketing techniques, reflecting implicit customer behaviour, and conventional market techniques, which involve explicit consumer behaviour. In this chapter, the authors have thoroughly reviewed neuromarketing techniques for the recognition of choice based on EEG signals. In addition, the authors also identified another area under-explored in neuromarketing studies i.e. data mining techniques for classifying and predicting customer choice recognition. This book chapter therefore provides a comprehensive review of the reported machine learning and deep-learning techniques for tracking customer choice recognition based on EEG data involving valence features and power spectral density. We found that the KNN + Fourier transform algorithm has the highest reported accuracy and is more reminiscent of support vector machine techniques and the nearest k-nearest neighbour. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Brain-computer interface (BCI); Customer choices; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Neuromarketing

Neuromarketing tools promise to overcome such limitations. In this study, we proposed a framework, MarketBrain, to predict consumer preferences. In our experiment, we administered marketing stimuli (five products with endorsements), collected EEG signals by EMOTIV EPOC+, and used signal processing and classification algorithms to develop the prediction system. Wavelet Packet Transform was used to extract frequency bands (δ, θ, α, β 1 , β 2 , γ) and then statistical features were extracted for classification. Among the classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the best accuracy (96.01±0.71) using 5-fold cross-validation. Results also suggested that specific target consumers and endorser appearance affect the prediction of the preference. So, it is evident that EEG-based neuromarketing tools can help brands and businesses effectively predict future consumer preferences.

This science can be observed in each ad, which makes the individual feel the need to spend money on a product. Big companies have benefited from this almost-magic formula that allows the emotion and reasoning behind each purchase. Thanks to neuromarketing, each product could be attractive enough in the neuro-sensory aspect for it to be consumed, science being the only needed thing.

It is probable that advertisers misjudge consumer behavior because predicted opinions do not always correspond to consumers’ actual purchase behaviors. Neuromarketing is the new paradigm of understanding customer buyer behavior and decision making, as well as the prediction of their gestures for product utilization through an unconscious process. Existing methods do not focus on effective preprocessing and classification techniques of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, so in this study, an effective method for preprocessing and classification of EEG signals is proposed. The proposed method involves effective preprocessing of EEG signals by removing noise and a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to deal with the class imbalance problem. The dataset employed in this study is a publicly available neuromarketing dataset. Automated features were extracted by using a long short-term memory network (LSTM) and then concatenated with handcrafted features like power spectral density (PSD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to create a complete feature set. The classification was done by using the proposed hybrid classifier that optimizes the weights of two machine learning classifiers and one deep learning classifier and classifies the data between like and dislike. The machine learning classifiers include the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and deep learning classifier (DNN). The proposed hybrid model outperforms other classifiers like RF, SVM, and DNN and achieves an accuracy of 96.89%. In the proposed method, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score were computed to evaluate and compare the proposed method with recent state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 by the authors.",DWT; EEG; LSTM; neuromarketing; PSD; SMOTE

It combines neurobiology with behavioral psychology to understand consumer behavior, more specifically about their decisions related to choices/preferences and purchase. The purpose of this review is to explore the potential of using neuroscientific methods for consumer sensory science research. By no means, this is an exhaustive review hindered by the fact that there are countless articles on neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience in the literature. The author has tried to show the applicability of neuroscientific methods in consumer sensory sciences, specifically electroencephalography and eye tracking, which could potentially “complement” the sensory methodologies to gain better consumer insight. Both these techniques are relatively inexpensive, portable, and minimally invasive techniques that are already being used by some sensory scientists. They could be incorporated with ease in the research portfolio of consumer sensory researchers who would like to use them to study consumer affect. It is recommended that the researchers use proper experimental design that takes into consideration the confounding variables as much as possible. The two methods mentioned before have been proven to be relatively reliable and repeatable. Lastly, these methods would also require ethical oversight because of the involvement of human subjects. © 2023 The Authors.

In face-to-face interactions, facial expressions convey non-verbal information among humans, which is an important task in human–machine interfaces. Since the early 1990s, it has attracted attention from researchers. Classical approaches to machine learning often involve complex processes of extraction of features and poor results. Significant research has been carried out over the past decade in the development of different methods of extraction, tracking and analysis of facial features. The analysis includes measuring facial feeling and recognition of expression by extracting options for classification victimization ancient machine learning algorithms and could be a complicated and long task in comparison to deep learning techniques. As per the literature survey, using machine learning algorithms, the achieved accuracy rate ranges between 75 to 90% for mostly four to six emotions from the facial data set. In this paper, a deep CNN, a recent advancement in deep learning, is employed, which might accurately interpret linguistics information out there in the face in an automatic manner while not hand-designing the feature descriptors to acknowledge seven completely different emotions, viz. neutral, anger, fear, happy, disgust, surprise and sad. Categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer algorithms are applied to coach D-CNN with a powerful classification power. This D-CNN is applied on well-known JAFFE data set which consists of seven emotions and ten subjects and could achieve an accuracy of 97.53%. Compared to machine learning, the number of parameters in D-CNN decreases intensively, accelerating the overall performance improvement and making this network well suited for real-time applications. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Deep convolution neural network (d-CNN); Deep learning; Facial emotion recognition (FER); Feature; JAFFE data set; Machine learning

In order to achieve insight information, marketers spend about $400 billion annually on marketing, promotion, and advertisement using traditional marketing research tools. In addition, these tools like personal depth interviews, surveys, focus group discussions, etc. are expensive and frequently criticized for failing to extract actual consumer preferences. Neuromarketing, on the other hand, promises to overcome such constraints. In this work, an EEG-based neuromarketing framework is employed for predicting consumer future choice (affective attitude) while they view E-commerce products. After preprocessing, three types of features, namely, time, frequency, and time-frequency domain features are extracted. Then, wrapper-based Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) along with correlation bias reduction is used for feature selection. Lastly, we use SVM for categorizing positive affective attitude and negative affective attitude. Experiments show that the frontal cortex achieves the best accuracy of 98.67±2.98, 98±3.22, and 98.67±3.52 for 5-fold, 10-fold, and leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) respectively. In addition, among all the channels, Fz achieves best accuracy 90±7.81, 90.67±9.53, and 92.67±7.03 for 5-fold, 10-fold, and LOSO respectively. Subsequently, this work opens the door for implementing such a neuromarketing framework using consumer-grade devices in a real-life setting for marketers. As a result, it is evident that EEG-based neuromarketing technologies can assist brands and enterprises in forecasting future consumer preferences accurately. Hence, it will pave the way for the creation of an intelligent marketing assistive system for neuromarketing applications in future. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Consumer behavior; Consumer neuroscience; Electroencephalography; Neuromarketing; Pattern recognition; Support vector machine

The focus here is to find which elements of the packaging affect consumers’ choices in selecting the exposed product. Two tasks relating to a restaurant and health clinic were introduced and distributed to the participants in a random manner. In these two tasks, the participants were instructed to choose among five brands of Camel-Doogh for consumption in a restaurant or health clinic. The statistical sample consisted of 30 students and staff members from the University of Shahid Beheshti in Tehran, Iran, in running the experiment. The eye-tracker measured the participants’ visual attention regarding these tasks. Measuring the level of attention and determining which packaging elements contribute to product selection can lead to more success in marketing a new product to the target market. The obtained results indicate that in the restaurant task, only the visual elements had a significant positive correlation with the individual’s choice. In the health clinic task, the visual elements led directly to product selection, and verbal elements led indirectly to product selection through brand awareness.

Eye-tracking technology in neuromarketing has been developed mainly using camera-based methods; however, camera-based eye-trackers are generally expensive for some customers, hindering widespread use of eye-tracking technology. Electrooculography (EOG)-based eye-tracking could be a promising alternative because it can be implemented at a relatively lower cost even less than 100 USD; however, EOG-based eye-tracking has not yet been employed in neuromarketing applications. In this study, we developed a method to estimate the absolute coordinates of eye gaze from EOG and investigated its reliability over time. The EOG signals were acquired in three separate experimental sessions: calibration, instructed eye-tracking test, and free eye-tracking test (FET) sessions. A linear regression model was constructed using the calibration data to estimate the absolute coordinates on the screen. The reconstructed eye-gaze results were visualized in the form of a heat map to be applied to practical neuromarketing scenarios. The results of the instructed eye-tracker test session revealed that the reliability of the eye-tracking results gradually decreased over time but did not drop drastically for up to 8 s. Moreover, the results of the neuromarketing test session analyzed with 6-s-EOG-data revealed clear gender differences among the heat maps of six advertisement pictures, coinciding with previous camera-based study results. Our results suggest that the proposed EOG-based eye-tracker has great potential to be utilized in practical neuromarketing applications.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.",Electrooculography (EOG); eye-tracking; gaze reconstruction; gender difference; neuromarketing

However, research shows that consumers’ behavior often does not conform to their value and orientations. This value-behavior gap is due to contextual factors such as price, product design, and social norms as well as individual factors such as personal and hedonic values, environmental beliefs, and the workload capacity an individual can handle. Because of this conflict of interest, consumers have a hard time identifying the true drivers of their behavior, as they are either unaware of or unwilling to acknowledge the processes at play. Therefore, consumer neuroscience methods might provide a valuable tool to uncover the implicit measurements of pro-environmental behavior (PEB). Several studies have already defined neurophysiological differences between green and non-green individuals; however, a behavior change intervention must be developed to motivate PEB among consumers. Motivating behavior with reward or punishment will most likely get users engaged in climate change action via brain structures related to the reward system, such as the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and (pre)frontal cortex, where the reward information and subsequent affective responses are encoded. The intensity of the reward experience can be increased when the consumer is consciously considering the action to achieve it. This makes goal-directed behavior the potential aim of behavior change interventions. This article provides an extensive review of the neuroscientific evidence for consumer attitude, behavior, and decision-making processes in the light of sustainability incentives for behavior change interventions. Based on this review, we aim to unite the current theories and provide future research directions to exploit the power of affective conditioning and neuroscience methods for promoting PEB engagement.

While this discipline has been developed in medical research and early applied in psychology research (Posner & DiGirolamo, 2000), applications in the field of marketing mainly focus on consumer behavior (Harris et al., 2018; Hubert & Kenning, 2008; Plassmann et al., 2015), and there on a more direct view into the “black box” of the consumer organism (Hubert & Kenning, 2008). For example, the preference for a brand, or the valuation of a price-setting can be associated to specific neural activations (Smidts et al., 2014). Yet, topics like pricing decisions or brand awareness are also important in the B2B sector (Hodgkinson et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014). Therefore, suggesting Neuroscience as a “bridging discipline” to B2B-Marketing seems comprehensible (Lindgreen et al., 2021). The application of consumer neuroscience has been recently discussed in B2B settings as well (Lim, 2018), but there is still a gap in structuring existing research that bridges both disciplines, and a lack of transparency on applications of neuroscientific insights and instruments in B2B-Marketing. This study aims to answer the following research questions: (RQ1) What is the current state of the art of Neuroscience research in B2B-Marketing? (RQ2) What suggestions for future research directions can be derived out of existing contributions? Hence, the main objective and contribution of this article is to offer an overview of neuroscience in marketing research with a particular focus on B2B studies and those studies whose results could be transferable to B2B marketing. We searched for relevant publications on Scopus. We considered neuroscience publications with reference to B2B or Industrial Marketing, and initially got 1,126 results. After screening, the resulted review list consists of 60 articles. These papers were classified using the framework-based review approach theory-context-characteristics-methodology (TCCM) (Paul & Criado, 2020; Tranfield et al., 2003) to paint a comprehensive and precise picture of the field and to outline a future research agenda. Our analysis shows that neuroscience in B2B is nascent, and the majority of publications are conceptual. Yet, some findings rooted in B2C could be transferred to B2B. Future research directions comprise empirical research focusing on implicit measurement in advertising, communication, pricing, trust formation in personal and human-computer interactions, sales performance, and general decision-making. With this, we hope to help further improve the principal psychological underpinnings of B2B-Marketing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",B2B marketing; Industrial marketing; Neuromarketing; Neuroscience; Systematic literature review; TCCM

There are now more affordable neuro-devices capturing the brainwave signals for various applications like design, marketing, and brain-computer interfaces. It is necessary to construct an algorithmic model that captures and analyzes data more effectively to facilitate the usage of such hardware. The traditional method is to measure the asymmetry index, that is, to subtract the natural log of the left alpha wave power from that of the right alpha wave power. However, this cannot indicate how alpha activities of the two separate hemispheres contribute to changes. Moreover, it cannot directly reflect alpha activation at a particular point of time and cannot determine when activation (if any) occurs after the presentation of a stimulus (like brand slogans). Based on analysis of the first derivative of alpha wave power, the proposed method effectively identifies alpha activation both visually and algorithmically, and it can identify the time of activation and the extent of activation precisely. The overall accuracy of the traditional method is 56.8 percent, while that of the suggested new method is 93.1 percent. © Common Ground Research Networks, Chi Hong Leung, Elvy Pang, All Rights Reserved.

Multimodal signals for emotion charting include electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and galvanic skin response (GSR) signals. EEG, ECG, and GSR are also known as physiological signals, which can be used for identification of human emotions. Due to the unbiased nature of physiological signals, this field has become a great motivation in recent research as physiological signals are generated autonomously from human central nervous system. Researchers have developed multiple methods for the classification of these signals for emotion detection. However, due to the non-linear nature of these signals and the inclusion of noise, while recording, accurate classification of physiological signals is a challenge for emotion charting. Valence and arousal are two important states for emotion detection; therefore, this paper presents a novel ensemble learning method based on deep learning for the classification of four different emotional states including high valence and high arousal (HVHA), low valence and low arousal (LVLA), high valence and low arousal (HVLA) and low valence high arousal (LVHA). In the proposed method, multimodal signals (EEG, ECG, and GSR) are preprocessed using bandpass filtering and independent components analysis (ICA) for noise removal in EEG signals followed by discrete wavelet transform for time domain to frequency domain conversion. Discrete wavelet transform results in spectrograms of the physiological signal and then features are extracted using stacked autoencoders from those spectrograms. A feature vector is obtained from the bottleneck layer of the autoencoder and is fed to three classifiers SVM (support vector machine), RF (random forest), and LSTM (long short-term memory) followed by majority voting as ensemble classification. The proposed system is trained and tested on the AMIGOS dataset with k-fold cross-validation. The proposed system obtained the highest accuracy of 94.5% and shows improved results of the proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 by the authors.",ECG signals; EEG signals; emotion charting; ensemble classifier; ICA; physiological signals; stacked autoencoder

Hence, neuromarketing, the application of neuroscience in the marketing field, is introduced aiming to understand customers' cognitive functions toward advertisements or products. Our study focused on identifying how the brain respond to different types of advertising image of the same brand were perceived using electroencephalogram (EEG). We performed an experiment using 33 different Coca-Cola advertising images in RSVP (rapid serial visual presentation) task on 23 participants. A seven channels EEG dry headset was used to record the visual event-related potential (ERP), specifically, the positive peak found at 300 to 700 ms after image onset; P300, to compare the perception response. We applied k-means and hierarchical clustering to the obtained EEG data, and achieved the best clustering for three clusters, yielding different P300 amplitudes and latencies. The typical Coca-Cola ads, red color with Cola-cola text on the ads, induced a faster and larger response, implying better perception than the unconventional or black color ads. We conclude that ERP clustering may be a useful tool for neuromarketing. However, the relationship between the EEG-based cluster and the image-based cluster should be further investigated to confirm the suggestion.  © 2022 Asia-Pacific of Signal and Information Processing Association (APSIPA).",

After stimulating a sensory organ, a positive deflection of the EEG signal between 250 and 700 ms can be measured. This signal component of the event-related potential (ERP) is called “P300.” Numerous studies have provided evidence that the P300 amplitude and latency are linked to sensory perception, engagement, and cognition. Combining the advances in technology, classification methods, and signal processing, we developed a novel image ranking system called the Unicorn Blondy Check. In this study, the application was tested on 21 subjects using three different visual oddball paradigms. Two consisted of female faces and gray-scale images, while the third test paradigm consisted of familiar and unfamiliar faces. The images were displayed for a duration of 150 ms in a randomized order. The system was trained using 50 trials and tested with 30 trials. The EEG data were acquired using the Unicorn Hybrid Black eight-channel BCI system. These synchronized recordings were analyzed, and the achieved classification accuracies were calculated. The EEG signal was averaged over all participants and for every paradigm separately. Analysis of the EEG data revealed a significant shift in the P300 latency dependent on the paradigm and decreased amplitude for a lower target to non-target ratio. The image ranking application achieved a mean accuracy of 100 and 95.5% for ranking female faces above gray-scale images with ratios of 1:11 and 5:11, respectively. In the case of four familiar faces to 24 unfamiliar faces, 86.4% was reached. The obtained results illustrate this novel system’s functionality due to accuracies above chance levels for all subjects. © Copyright © 2021 Sutaj, Walchshofer, Schreiner, Turchet, Pretl and Guger.",BCI; cognition; EEG; familiarity; image-ranking; neuromarketing; P300; VEP

Neuromarketing closely relates to neuropsychology and market research for studying the cognitive thinking process of customers and their responses to the marketing stimuli. Presently no study has investigated the moderating role of firm leadership support in promoting neuromarketing applications in their firm. However, there is a huge interest among researchers and industry practitioners to understand this phenomenon and how leadership support can sponsor and invest in neuromarketing related programs in their marketing departments. Against this background, the objective of this study is to examine the role of firm leadership support in promoting neuromarketing and the consequences of it. With the help of marketing theories and literature, a theoretical model has been developed. Later, the model is validated using the CB-SEM technique using 372 responses from employees in marketing departments of various firms. The study finds that there is a significant and positive impact of neuromarketing on customer loyalty, improving business value, and marketing performance of the firms, which in turn significantly impacts the competitive advantage of the firms.

Past studies have provided an inconsistent understanding of this phenomenon and its underlying psychological processes. Others have called for research on more integrated and effective marketing communications about typical–local foods to increase destination attractiveness, help consumer decision-making processes and reduce information asymmetry in the food tourism market. Through the application of an integrated framework under the umbrella of signaling theory, we focus on various signals (e.g., “food security,” “trusting relationships,” “emotional value”) associated with three key features of typical–local foods: sustainability, geographical indications and healthiness. We use a combination of neuroscience techniques, including the implicit priming test, eye-tracking and electroencephalography, to investigate which signals are best at communicating typical–local foods' distinctiveness. We find that consumers/tourists perceive healthiness as typical–local foods' most engaging and attractive product feature, followed by geographical indications then sustainability. Specific signals impact people's visual attention and cognitive engagement differently, with social and emotional attributes being most appealing. Therefore, food tourism managers should focus on these attributes in their communication campaigns to increase food tourism attractiveness and enhance travel experience. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",electroencephalography; eye-tracking; food tourism; implicit priming test; marketing communications; neuromarketing; typical–local food

In this paper, we show that visual attention can be retrieved from EEG acquisition. The results are comparable to traditional predictions from observed images, which is of great interest. Image-based saliency estimation being participant independent, the estimation from EEG could take into account the subject specificity. For this purpose, a set of signals has been recorded, and different models have been developed to study the relationship between visual attention and brain activity. The results are encouraging and comparable with other approaches estimating attention with other modalities. Being able to predict a visual saliency map from EEG could help in research studying the relationship between brain activity and visual attention.

Neuroscientific methods have expanded research capabilities in marketing and created new insights into consumer behavior and decision making processes. Both machine learning and deep learning approaches can be employed to predict relevant consumer preference from brain activity. The former requires extensive signal processing and feature engineering for classification whereas the later relies on raw brain signals and thus avoids time-consuming preprocessing. In this paper, the performance of a machine learning model comprising an ensemble of algorithms was compared to the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) on two independently collected EEG datasets, one concerning product choices and the other movie ratings. While both models showed poor performance for prediction of product choices, the convolutional neural network proved more accurate in the prediction of movie ratings. This provides evidence for the superiority of deep learning algorithms in certain neuromarketing prediction tasks. We discuss the limitations and future application opportunities.  © 2021 Owner/Author.",Deep Learning; EEG; Machine Learning; Neuromarketing; User preference

In this article, we have followed a literature review methodology and a bibliometric analysis to select empirical and review papers that employed neuroimaging tools in advertising campaigns and to understand the global research trends in the neuromarketing domain. We extracted and analyzed sixty‐three articles from the Web of Science database to answer our study questions. We found four common neuroimaging techniques employed in advertising research. We also found that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex play a vital role in decision‐making processes. The OFC is linked to positive valence, and the lateral OFC and left dorsal anterior insula related in negative valence. In addition, the thalamus and primary visual area associated with the bottom‐up attention system, whereas the top‐down attention system connected to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and primary visual areas. For memory, the hippocampus is responsible for generating and processing memories. We hope that this study provides valuable insights about the main brain regions and processes of interest for advertising. © 2021 by the authors.

Simply said, computer vision is used precisely to recognize and process the inputs. This system allows the scanner of a barcode to 'read' a cluster of lines and convert it into a sequence of numbers. Likewise, when the smartphone can detect if it is the phone user's face through a facial scan. Similar applications can also be found in industry, in autonomous vehicles, where it is used to monitor driving lanes or passing vehicles, or in obtaining implicit feedback in marketing research when evaluating user experience in digital environments, for example. This is the area that User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) designers are dealing with. Their task is to design a sufficiently intuitive and interesting solution that will be available no matter what device is used (computer/smartphone) and at the same time the customers / visitors can easily reach their goal or get the information they need in just a couple of clicks. The foundations for UX design changes can now be gathered not only through online analytical tools, but especially by using neuromarketing tools that use advanced computer vision and data mining systems.

This study provides a deeper understanding of customer experience in two coffee stores in Vietnam by providing a multidisciplinary approach, including a quantitative and a neuromarketing approach. Two-hundred participants participated in the study, combining mystery shopping visits with the Brand Association Reaction Time Test (BARTT). Results from the mystery shopping visits confirm the holistic concept of customer experience. Store atmosphere, employee service, drink quality, price, and previous visits significantly impact customer experience. Empirical results also confirm the impact of customer experience on loyalty. Furthermore, the BARTT analysis shows that in-store customer experience can influence customers' short-term brand perceptions. The national brand is associated with friendly, expensive, globalized, and unique, whereas the local brand revealed significant associations with clean, smells good, welcoming, and unique. From the mystery shopping results and the BARTT, we can infer that customer experience needs multi-methodological capturing of its multifaceted aspects.

In this paper, the EEG signal is used to evaluate the cognitive response of subjects during watching test video clips. The measurements are performed with 25 subjects using eight channels while simultaneously running the video clips. The β and γwaves of the EEG signal are used to extract the features that represent the evoked activity in each group of frames using the Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) technique. Significant EEG patterns are derived from the time-correlated measurements, which can be related to the subjects' interests. In addition, the conjunctions that represent the occurrence of segments-of-interest in more than one channel are determined. The results show that ~15% of the segments attracted the attention of the viewers in each test video clip.

Particularly, electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) have been popular techniques to obtain cognitive-relevant biosignals. However, current wearable systems may still pose practical inconvenience, motivating further interest to integrate EOG+EEG recording into streamlined frontal-only sensor montages with sufficient signal fidelity. We propose, here, a spatial filtering approach to reliably extract EOG signals from a reduced set of frontal EEG electrodes, placed on non-hair-bearing (NHB) areas. Within a common signal analytic framework, two distinct schemes are examined. The one is based on standard linear least squares (LLS) and the other on Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Both schemes are data-driven techniques, require a small amount of training data, and lead to reliable estimators of EOG activity from EEG signals. The LASSO-based technique, in addition, provides guidelines that generalize well across subjects. Using experimental data, we provide some empirical evidence that our estimators can replace the actual EOG signals in algorithmic pipelines that automatically detect oculographic events, like blinks and saccades. © 2021 IEEE.",

A number of approaches have been proposed that use machine learning (ML) technology to achieve high recognition performance, which relies on engineering features from brain activity dynamics. Since ML performance can be improved by utilizing 2D feature representation that exploits the spatial relationships among the features, here we propose a novel input representation that involves re-arranging EEG features as an image that reflects the top view of the subject's scalp. This approach enables emotion recognition through image-based ML methods such as pre-trained deep neural networks or 'trained-from-scratch' convolutional neural networks. We have employed both of these techniques in our study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed input representation. We also compare the recognition performance of these methods against state-of-the-art tabular data analysis approaches, which do not utilize the spatial relationships between the sensors. We test our proposed approach using two publicly available benchmark datasets for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks, namely DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI. Our results show that the 'trained-from-scratch' convolutional neural network outperforms the best approaches in the literature, achieving 97.8% and 98.3% accuracy in valence and arousal classification on MAHNOB-HCI, and 91% and 90.4% on DEAP, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.",Convolutional neural networks; electroencephalography; emotion recognition; spatial information representation

Therefore, Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has been widely introduced to wide fields of applications, such as security, psychotherapy, neuromarketing, and advertisement. Feature extraction and selection are two essential key issues for the design of efficient FER systems. However, most of the previous studies focused on implementing static feature selection methods. Although these methods have shown promising results, they still present weaknesses, especially when dealing with spontaneous expressions. This is mainly due to the specificity of each face, which makes the facial emotion display differs from one subject to another. To address this problem, we propose a face-based dynamic feature selection of two geometric features sub-classes, namely linear and eccentricity features. This combination provides a better understanding of the facial transformation during the emotion display. Moreover, the suggested selection method takes into consideration the subject’s general facial structure, muscle movements, and head position. The performed experiments, using the CK+ and the DISFA datasets, have showed that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques and maintains superior performance with cross-dataset validation. In fact, the accuracy of facial expression recognition by the proposed method reaches 97.72% and 91,26% on the CK+ and the DISFA datasets, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Face-based feature selection; Facial expression recognition; Feature extraction; Geometrical features; Subject-dependency

It is a consequence of the development and evolution of digital society. Technological innovation, fundamentally oriented toward virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed realities, contributes significantly to the creation of a solid foundation on which to build an entire universe of virtual worlds. This is a universe that, in turn, requires the creation of backbone content for narratives that attract and retain users by capturing their attention to promote a specific ecosystem that transfers the activities of the real world to a virtual one, either projected or recreated. This research is based on a systematic review of 402 articles and a qualitative analysis of 125 publications indexed in Scopus. It examines the trends in technology, application, and methodology pertaining to the metaverse in the social sciences field, namely marketing and communication and neuroscience, areas that contribute to the understanding of the social dimension of the metaverse phenomenon. Although there is abundant academic literature on the metaverse in computer science, this is not the case in the aforementioned disciplines. Given that the metaverse is destined to become the next Internet revolution, there is a race among countries and brands to position themselves within it, which is expected to intensify in the coming years. The metaverse can contribute to a wide variety of applications of a social nature, which is why it is a highly competitive tool for nations, companies, and academia, as well as the public and private media. The results indicate a technological transformation proposing a future that includes neuro-technologies based on brain–computer interfaces and the metaverse as the setting. This will occur alongside the solidification of the virtual ecosystem thanks to the emergence of digital natives and Gen Z, as well as the convergence of many different technologies and immersive and participatory content, in which the consumer is the provider, owner, and beneficiary. © 2023, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Non-verbal communication methods like facial expressions, eye movement and gestures are used in many application of human computer interaction, which among them facial emotion is widely used because it convey the emotional states and feelings of persons. The emotion recognition is not an easy task because there is no landmark distinction between the emotions on the face and also there are a lot of complexity and variability. In the traditional machine learning algorithm some important extracted features used for modeling the face, so, it can not achieve high accuracy rate for recognition of emotion because the features are hand-engineered and depend on prior knowledge. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have developed in this work for recognition facial emotion expression and classify them into seven basic categories. Instead of calculating hand-engineered features, CNN calculates features by learning automatically. The novelty of the proposed method is using facial action units (AUs) of the face which first these units are recognized by C NN and incorporate to recognizing the seven basic emotion states. To evaluated the proposed model, Cohn-Kanade database is used so that the model achieves the best accuracy rate 97.01 by incorporating AU while other works in the literature used a direct CNN and achieve accuracy rate 95.75. © 2017 IEEE.",Action Unit; Classification; Convolutional neural networks; Emotion

The goal is to enable the identification of user emotions through a webcam, using convolutional neural networks. The first part of the paper describes the neural networks, the basic types, and their differences. The greatest attention has been given to the description and application of convolutional neural networks. A Convolutional Neural Network, also known as CNN, is specialized in processing data that has a grid-like topology, such as an image. User emotion recognition is enabled using the face-api.js library. It implements the following models: SSD Mobilenet V1, Tiny Face Detector and MTCNN. Tiny Face Detector, used in the application, is a model for real-time face detection with small size, speed, and moderate resource consumption. The model is compatible with the web and mobile platforms. In the second part of the paper, an application was developed, which uses the face-api.js library to detect emotions. It has been developed as a tool to support neuromarketing research. It allows the marketer to create research to analyze advertising material. Its basic functionality is to display advertising content and collect data while watching. Data is stored and graphically displayed to the marketer. This section describes in detail how the detection process works. In the third part of the paper, evaluation was made. Evaluation of the developed solution was performed by experiment. The results show that the emotions of the user can be recognized by the developed system, with a satisfactory level of precision. The advertising content has previously entered parameters, which represent the desired results. By comparing these parameters and the obtained results, the marketer decides whether the advertisement is successful. © 2019 IEEE.",emotion detection; face coding; neural networks; neuromarketing

With the majority rule based on an electroencephalogram (EEG), a technique to determine the attention of multiple users is proposed. In general, a single-shot EEG ensures short-time response, but it is inevitably deteriorated by artifacts. To enhance the accuracy of the majority rule, the collaborative signals of P300 evoked potentials are focused. The collaborative P300 signal is prepared by averaging individual single-shot P300 signals among subjects. In experiments, the EEG signals of twelve volunteers were collected by using auditory stimuli. The subjects paid attention to target stimuli and no attention to standard stimuli. The collaborative P300 signal was used to evaluate the performance of the majority rule. The proposed algorithm enables us to estimate the degree of attention of the group. The classification is based on supervised machine learning, and the accuracy approximately 80%.

The aim of this review is to understand how and whether neuroscientific technologies can be effectively employed to better understand the human behaviour in real decision-making contexts. To do so, firstly, we will describe the historical development of neuromarketing and its main applications in assessing the sensory perceptions of some marketing and advertising stimuli. Then, we will describe the main neuroscientific tools available for such kind of investigations (e.g., measuring the cerebral electrical or hemodynamic activity, the eye movements, and the psychometric responses). Also, this review will present different brain measurement techniques, along with their pros and cons, and the main cerebral indexes linked to the specific mental states of interest (used in most of the neuromarketing research). Such indexes have been supported by adequate validations from the scientific community and are largely employed in neuromarketing research. This review will also discuss a series of papers that present different neuromarketing applications, such us in-store choices and retail, services, pricing, brand perception, web usability, neuropolitics, evaluation of the food and wine taste, and aesthetic perception of artworks. Furthermore, this work will face the ethical issues arisen on the use of these tools for the evaluation of the human behaviour during decision-making tasks.

Rarely has the ethical and legal nature of the field been subjected to substantial comment and discussion. This viewpoint article draws attention to some inherent ethical concerns and legal challenges that may come with future developments in pricing, in particular online personalized pricing, thereby seeking to initiate a broader discussion about issues such as dishonesty, unfairness, injustice, and misconduct in pricing and revenue management practices. Reflecting on how legislators and regulators in Europe seek to limit recent developments in personalized pricing, we argue that not much is to be expected from the legal system, at least not in the short run, with regard to guiding the pricing and revenue field in setting and implementing minimum standards of behavior. Scholarly attention should however not only be directed to the legal challenges of new forms of direct price discrimination, such as algorithmic personalized dynamic pricing, but also to the ethical and legal implications of more granular forms of indirect price discrimination, through which consumers will be allowed to ‘freely’ sort themselves into different microsegments, especially when the ‘self-selection’ is enticed by deceptive personalized applications of psychological pricing and neuromarketing. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",Algorithmic pricing; Behavioral targeting; Ethic; Legal; Neuromarketing; Personalized pricing; Price discrimination; Psychological pricing; Revenue management

After a new product has been developed, the product developers hire ordinary people and give an interview to them. In recent years, a new method called 'neuromarketing' is used for product evaluation. However, it is difficult to use the conventional measurement devices and they are mainly used in an experimental environment. In this paper, we developed the model to estimate human emotions, especially valence by using single-channel EEG device. We used the fast Fourier transform, the robust scaling and the support vector regression to predict the valence score. The parameters of the methods were selected by using the grid search and the genetic algorithm. The designed model was evaluated by the correlation coefficient and the classification accuracy of two classes between predicted valence data and labeled valence data.

Each discipline has been trying to study and predict human behaviour through surveys, laboratory-based experiments, questionnaires, interviews, statistics, focus groups; the list is endless. The lack of precision in the existing techniques to predict human behaviour has motivated researchers to move beyond the traditional and search for new and improved techniques. Neuroscience has stepped in to fill this gap. It is based on the assumption that human behaviour is a complex process which has a neural basis and the locus of this process is the higher centre of the brain. Both conscious and unconscious processing of stimulus in the brain is responsible for generating behaviour. So if we could develop a deeper understanding of how the brain functions to generate behaviour, we would be more confident in our understanding and prediction of consumer behaviour. The use of neuroscientific techniques, like functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), Evoked Response Potential (ERP), and sensors to measure changes in one's physiological state, to understand the mind of the consumer has just begun, and professionals in the field see a huge opportunity for neuromarketing in India. In the domain of neuromarketing, one important question relates to the distinction between Indian and other global consumers of commercial products. Are we different from consumers across the globe? The answer is probably 'yes'. This is documented by the fact that we find a distinct change in the marketing strategy of companies; the methods to influence Indian consumers are different from those adopted in other countries. This gives rise to the question: what makes us different? The next logical question that arises, assuming that we are different or similar, is can we quantify it? Answering why, what and how we are different marks the beginning of the book, followed by issues related to the ethicality of using such techniques to promote marketing, risk analysis in case of failure and future directions in neuromarketing. The book intends to address each of these issues so that a comprehensive reading in the subject matter would help academicians to decipher consumer behaviour and build theory for possible principles of application in the market. © 2019 Tanusree Dutta and Manas Kumar Mandal.

The application of neuromarketing techniques to the study of food packaging has recently gained considerable popularity both in academia and practice, but there are still some concerns about the methods and metrics commercially offered and the interpretation of their findings. This represents the motivation of this investigation, whose objective is twofold: (1) to analyze the methodologies and measurements commonly used in neuromarketing commercial research on packaging, and (2) to examine the extent to which the results of food packaging studies applying neuromarketing techniques can be reproduced under similar methodologies. Obtained results shed light on the application of neuromarketing techniques in the evaluation of food packaging and reveal that neuromarketing and declarative methodologies are complementary, and its combination may strengthen the studies’ results. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of having a framework that improves the validity and reliability of neuromarketing studies to eradicate mistrust toward the discipline and provide brands with valuable insights into food packing design. © 2020 by the authors.

These technologies collect and integrate data on consumers’ brains for big data analytics. The purpose of this paper is to identify new opportunities and challenges for neuromarketing as an applied neuroscience. Design/methodology/approach: The authors discuss conceptual and methodological contributions of neuromarketing based on studies that have employed neural approaches in market-related investigations, explaining the various tools and designs of neuromarketing research. The authors identify marketing-related questions to which neuroscientific approaches can make meaningful contributions, evaluating several challenges that lie ahead for neuromarketing. Findings: The authors summarize the contributions of neuromarketing and discuss synergistic findings that neuromarketing has the potential to yield. Research limitations/implications: The authors ask: do consumers’ self-reported choices and their neural representations tell different stories?; what are the effects of subtle and peripheral marketing stimuli?; and can neuromarketing help to reveal the underlying causal mechanisms for perceptual and learning processes, such as motivation and emotions? Practical implications: The authors identify marketing-related questions to which neuroscientific approaches can make meaningful contributions, evaluating several challenges that lie ahead for neuromarketing. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no current review has identified avenues for future research in neuromarketing and the emerging challenges that researchers may face. The current paper aims to update readers on what neuroscience and other psychophysiological measures have achieved, as well as what these tools have to offer in the field of marketing.

Yet other authors postulate the countless advantages stemming from a better understanding of the consumers' wishes enabling organizations to design offers which are more adapted to their private and innermost desires. Due to the controversy that its development and application have created, the need to legitimize this new stream of marketing is therefore evident.

However, despite its development in the academic world, in the professional sector, its use is still very limited. The aim of this work was to find out the perception of advertising professionals as regards neuromarketing techniques for identifying its advantages and disadvantages compared to other research techniques, as well as the reasons why the use of neuromarketing is so much lower than expected in the Spanish market. The technique chosen for data gathering was the semi-structured interview, which made it possible to go into more depth with the subjects that came up. The interview, after a pre-selection of 100 professionals who matched the set criteria, was carried out individually, face-to-face, with a sample of 30 people with considerable professional experience in the field of marketing, sales communication, and market research; all of them belonged to leading companies from the sector. Once the information had been categorized into units with common themes, the results obtained were interpreted to explain how neuromarketing techniques are being used in the field of advertising. The results obtained led us to the conclusion that, even though neuromarketing provides more objective data and it is closer to what really happens to consumers when they are exposed to an advertising message, the ignorance of its true possibilities, the inability of suppliers of these techniques to transmit the value they add to research, its complexity, its high cost and time requirements explain why it has had scarce use in advertising research. The results revealed the real reasons for the rejection of neuromarketing techniques which, in turn, will make it possible to introduce both technological and formative solutions, allowing it to be incorporated into future research designs. © Copyright © 2020 Baños-González, Baraybar-Fernández and Rajas-Fernández.",advertising; cognitive responses; consumer behavior; market research; marketing; neuroeconomics; neuromarketing; neuroscience

The study of the human brain using EEG is related to electronics, psychology, and cognitive neuroscience to study the human behavior on problem solving and decision making. In this paper, we particularly investigate the decision making of the human brain in a short period of time. The study is focused on which band wave is dominant when use for decision making and subconscious mind. The EEG was used to study the cognition in different states of mind because EEG can analyze the brain activity directly from the scalp. Experiments were conducted to examine the wave of the brain by using the 14-channel EEG Emotiv Epoch device. The brain memory recalls and makes a decision of what they want or experience. The result shows that the human brain can recall a product by experience and beneficial to their understanding. This proves that subconscious mind and decision making has always been and existing in our daily lives. The result from the experiment showed that theta band wave was dominant during subconscious mind and decision making. © 2018 Penerbit Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.",Cognitive neuroscience; Decision making; EEG; Human brain; Neuromarketing; Subconscious mind

The ability to correctly identify likes and dislikes would facilitate novel applications in neuromarketing, affective entertainment, virtual rehabilitation and forensic neuroscience that leverage on sub-conscious human preferences. In this neuroinformatics investigation, we seek to recognize human preferences passively through the use of electroencephalography (EEG) when a subject is presented with some 3D visual stimuli. Our approach employs the use of machine learning in the form of deep neural networks to classify brain signals acquired using a brain-computer interface (BCI). Our previous work has shown that EEG preference classification is possible although accuracy rates remain relatively low at 61%–67% using conventional deep learning neural architectures, where the challenge mainly lies in the accurate classification of unseen data from a cohort-wide sample that introduces inter-subject variability on top of the existing intra-subject variability. Such an approach is significantly more challenging and is known as subject-independent EEG classification as opposed to the more commonly adopted but more time-consuming and less general approach of subject-dependent EEG classification. In this new study, we employ deep networks that allow dropouts to occur in the architecture of the neural network. The results obtained through this simple feature modification achieved a classification accuracy of up to 79%. Therefore, this study has shown that the use of a deep learning classifier was able to achieve an increase in emotion classification accuracy of between 13%–18% through the simple adoption of the use of dropouts compared to a conventional deep learner for EEG preference classification. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Deep learning; Dropouts; Electroencephalography (EEG); Emotion classification; Neuroinformatics; Preference classification

FNIRS is a noninvasive optical brain imaging technique that combines the measurements of cerebral blood flow and hemodynamic response in a specific brain area when neural activity occurs. Nevertheless, the feasibility of mobile fNIRS has not yet been verified, because it is rarely used in neuroeconomic and neuromarketing studies. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of mobile fNIRS for marketing and economic research situations. Twelve subjects viewed three different advertisements of the same product, and then rated these pictures. All pictures showed the same product, but with different surroundings. The surroundings included an attractive female and male, shown to male and, respectively, female subjects, a cat, and a relatively neutral landscape. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the activation of the prefrontal cortex when viewing the different pictures. This was especially noticeable for the sexual picture and the childlike picture compared with the landscape. Also, significant differences were found on the group level and between subgroups. The activation was higher for the childlike picture than for the sexual picture, and this effect was stronger for the female subgroup. In addition, significantly higher activation was found during decision-making processes. The results of the present study suggest that using fNIRS is a promising method for measuring economic decision-making processes and consumer attention. © 2018 American Psychological Association.",attention; brain activity; decision-making; neuroeconomics; neuromarketing

The research field of brain reading assesses to which degree it is possible to infer a person's thoughts from their brain processes. The key idea is that every thought is associated with characteristic brain activation patterns. By training a computer to recognize these patterns it is possible to determine thoughts from brain activity. To date, several types of thoughts have already been read out. This includes visual percepts and images, memories, intentions, emotions and even the content of dreams. In certain cases it is even possible to read out more about a person's mental processes than they themselves are aware of. For example, under certain conditions it is possible to predict a person's intentions even before they are aware of them. Despite the recent success brain reading nonetheless runs into its limits. For principled reasons it is difficult to read out arbitrary thoughts or to transfer knowledge from one person to another. Thus, it is still a long way to a hypothetical universal thought reading machine that would allow to immediately read arbitrary thoughts of an arbitrary participant. However, already today several applications have been proposed, such as in forensics and criminology, in the control of computers and artificial prostheses and in neuromarketing. However, these technologies are still far from mature for reliable applications. Furthermore, they raise considerable ethical questions. ©Georg Thieme Verlag KG 2018",Functional magnetic resonance imaging; lie detection; mind reading; neuromarketing; pattern recognition

There are numerous advantages of using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for personal identification, such as uniqueness and anti-deceptiveness. Currently, many researchers focus on single-dataset personal identification, instead of the cross-dataset. In this paper, we propose a method for cross-dataset personal identification based on a brain network of EEG signals. First, brain functional networks are constructed from the phase synchronization values between EEG channels. Then, some attributes of the brain networks including the degree of a node, the clustering coefficient and global efficiency are computed to form a new feature vector. Lastly, we utilize linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to classify the extracted features for personal identification. The performance of the method is quantitatively evaluated on four datasets involving different cognitive tasks: (i) a four-class motor imagery task dataset in BCI Competition IV (2008), (ii) a two-class motor imagery dataset in the BNCI Horizon 2020 project, (iii) a neuromarketing dataset recorded by our laboratory, (iv) a fatigue driving dataset recorded by our laboratory. Empirical results of this paper show that the average identification accuracy of each data set was higher than 0.95 and the best one achieved was 0.99, indicating a promising application in personal identification. © 2019 Wanzeng Kong, et al..",brain network; EEG; personal identification; phase synchronization

To this effect, electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely used due to several of its advantages, including noninvasiveness and cost-effectiveness. EEG provides information about electrical activities of neural functions collected typically with scalp electrodes. As EEG-based knowledge is expanding, EEG systems are being used in more sophisticated technologies including brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neuromodulation protocols. This type of noninvasive neuroimaging technique has growing applications in various fields including engineering, psychology and neuroscience, clinical and neurological domains, and neuromarketing.

Amygdala and frontal cortex are two main parts of brain which are highly responsible for cognition and emotion. Now days, human inner feelings reside inside and try to hide its natural response. The human predictive emotion using artificial intelligence, pattern recognition is useful for analyzing neuromarketing behavior. Neuromarketing application area is used to study consumer behavior in order to take review of any product. Earlier, people will collect reviews in groups, surveys etc. Cognitive analysis technique is more beneficial than conventional methods. In this research work, proposed dataset is used to analyse human response while watching advertisement videos. In advertisement videos, emotions of human drive them to purchase and donate money. So, the human response is collected by using EEG device. This response is useful for researchers in neuromarketing, to analyse which product requires improvement or which is in demand.

Many studies have addressed stress prediction based on machine learning from the features measured by sensors attached to a subject's body. Meanwhile, as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have increased in popularity, head motion data from users watching VR/AR contents have become ubiquitous. In addition, stress prediction from head motion can be valuable because it does not rely on skin condition (e.g., sweat, tattoo, and cosmetics) and is not detrimental to usability. However, the effectiveness of stress prediction based on head motion data is not well understood.

The ability to detect excitement has many potential applications such as in affective entertainment, neuromarketing and particularly in virtual reality computer gaming. Users are exposed to a roller-coaster experience as the emotional stimuli, which is expected to evoke the emotion of excitement, while simultaneously wearing virtual reality goggles, which delivers the virtual reality experience of excitement, and an EEG headset, which acquires the raw brain signals detected when exposed to this excitement stimuli. In this study, a deep learning approach is used to improve the excitement detection rate to well above the 90% accuracy level.

Doing this with brain waves is not a science fiction anymore. The first steps for device control by brain are already made. The main challenge is identification and classification of the human waves corresponding to the movement, emotions and so on. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) devices provide a connection between the user's brain and the computer. These can be observed in our daily life, such as Medical Applications, Neuroergonomics and Smart Environment, Neuromarketing and Advertising, Education and Self-Regulation, Games and Entertainment, Security and Authentication, etc. To reach the best result a reliable classification of BCI signals is needed. Controlling machines and making science fiction with the power of our mind is a reality today. This study deals with increasing accuracy of the processing and classification of the Brain Wave Signals. This approach is based on pre-determination of the channels with useful information and consequently precise classification of the signals. In this experiment, the BCI device Emotiv 14-Epoc is used for collecting brain signals. They are received from BCI devices. The signals classified are based on the Mixed Linear Programming (MLP). This is an approximation to reach the goal-precise identification of brain signals. The results indicate the necessity of approaches that enhance the characteristics: capabilities and quality. The main results of the presented work show the accuracy of signals identification is improved from 60% to 90% when preliminary determination of the channels is done. © 2019 IEEE.",BCI applications; BCI challenges; Brain monitoring; Brain signal acquisition; Brain signal classification; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Computer science; Mind commands; Neural networks

Design/methodology/approach: The oxygenation signals extracted from the purchase trials of each subject were temporally averaged to obtain average signals for buy and pass decisions. The obtained data were analyzed via both linear mixed models for each of the 16 optodes to explore their separate role in the purchasing decision process and a discriminant analysis to construct a classifier for buy/pass decisions based on oxygenation measures from multiple optodes. Findings: Positive purchasing decisions significantly increase the neural activity through fronto-polar regions, which are closely related to OFC and vmPFC that modulate the computation of subjective values. The results showed that neural activations can be used to decode the buy or pass decisions with 85 per cent accuracy provided that sensitivity to the budget constraint is provided as an additional factor. Research limitations/implications: The study shows that the fNIRS measures can provide useful biomarkers for improving the classification accuracy of purchasing tendencies and might be used as a main or complementary method together with traditional research methods in marketing. Future studies might focus on real-time purchasing processes in a more ecologically valid setting such as shopping in supermarkets. Originality/value: This paper uses an emerging neuroimaging method in consumer neuroscience, namely, fNIRS. The decoding accuracy of the model is 85 per cent which presents an improvement over the accuracy levels reported in previous studies. The research also contributes to existing knowledge by providing insights in understanding individual differences and heterogeneity in consumer behavior through neural activities. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Decision-making; fNIRS; Neuromarketing; Optical brain imaging; Purchasing behavior; Purchasing decision

However, knowledge about neuroscience tools that are used in consumer neuroscience research is scattered. In this article, we present the results of a literature review that aims to provide an overview of the available consumer neuroscience tools and classifies them according to their characteristics. We analyse a total of 219 full-texts in the area of consumer neuroscience. Our findings suggest that there are seven tools that are currently used in consumer neuroscience research. In particular, electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking (ET) are the most commonly used tools in the field. We also find that consumer neuroscience tools are used to study consumer preferences and behaviors in different marketing domains such as advertising, branding, online experience, pricing, product development and product experience. Finally, we identify two ready-to-use platforms, namely iMotions and GRAIL that can help in integrating the measurements of different consumer neuroscience tools simultaneously. Measuring brain activity and physiological responses on a common platform could help by (1) reducing time and costs for experiments and (2) linking cognitive and emotional aspects with neuronal processes. Overall, this article provides relevant input in setting directions for future research and for business applications in consumer neuroscience. We hope that this study will provide help to researchers and practitioners in identifying available, non-invasive and useful tools to study consumer behavior. © Copyright © 2020 Alvino, Pavone, Abhishta and Robben.",consumer neuroscience; GRAIL; iMotion; marketing; neuromarketing; neurophysiological tools; physiological tools; review

It is one of the most recent marketing research strategies and may become the future of marketing research. Many research works have been carried out in this area to obtain better outcomes. However, literature shows that there is an opportunity for further improvement. Hence, in this study, a model is presented using data mining and machine learning algorithms for consumer behavior analysis from EEG signals. Time-frequency distribution features are extracted from EEG signals on which different classification algorithms are applied. Consumer's responses toward marketing strategies and their behavior towards purchasing or selecting goods can be studied and analyzed to understand the producer-consumer relationship. EEG signals from 25 people are collected where the participants varied in age and gender for a better understanding of consumer behavior towards a marketing policy. By analyzing the data, the reason behind how and why they like certain marketing policies was uncovered. The performance of our proposed model with an existing technique is compared. The accuracy of our model on the dataset is 95%, whereas the accuracy of the existing technique on the same dataset is 70%. We also evaluated whether neuropsychological measures can capture differences in consumer's actions according to different marketing stimuli. The experimental results on our model indicate that studies in this field can bring a change and improve marketing strategies for the betterment of both the producer and the consumer, resulting in an eventual mutual benefit.  © 2020 IEEE.",Consumer; Decision Tree; EEG; Marketing Strategy; Neuromarketing; Neuropsychology

The goal for the Biometric Method part was to measure and record human biometric, emotional signals (from the face, eyes, heart rate, respiration rate, etc.). The neuromarketing method is also integrated into the study with an aim to examine the affective and cognitive reactions of buyers to marketing incentives and to forecast customer actions by applying biometric technologies. The aim of the affective computing method part was to understand the emotional state of buyers and to tailor its action to the neuromarketing process by providing the most rational reaction to those emotions. The research also incorporated the multiple criteria planning of variants and the multiple criteria analysis methods into one entity. The application of these makes it possible to generate numerous alternative neuromarketing variants in an automatic fashion and to select the most effective ones. The VINERS Method for Housing can additionally assist in determining the Net emotional investment value of a project under deliberation and provide digital recommendations for improving projects. The VINERS Method for Housing was developed during the course of the research. A case study appears at the end of this article in an endeavor to demonstrate the opportunities provided by this method in practice. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

In this study, the effect of loud and rhythmic music in a sample neuromarketing setup is investigated. The second aim was to develop an approach in the prediction of preference using only brain signals. In this work, 19-channel EEG signals were recorded and two experimental paradigms were implemented: no music/silence and rhythmic, loud music using a headphone, while viewing women shoes. For each 10-sec epoch, normalized power spectral density (PSD) of EEG data for six frequency bands was estimated using the Burg method. The effect of music was investigated by comparing the mean differences between music and no music groups using independent two-sample t-test. In the preference prediction part sequential forward selection, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and the support vector machines (SVM), and 5-fold cross-validation approaches were used. It is found that music did not affect like decision in any of the power bands, on the contrary, music affected dislike decisions for all bands with no exceptions. Furthermore, the accuracies obtained in preference prediction study were between 77.5 and 82.5% for k-NN and SVM techniques. The results of the study showed the feasibility of using EEG signals in the investigation of the music effect on purchasing behavior and the prediction of preference of an individual. © TÜBİTAK.",Decision making; Electroencephalography; Music effect; Neuromarketing; Normalized band powers

Some of these could, in principle, also be used in forensic psychiatry. The application of these methods in forensic psychiatry could, for instance, be helpful to increase the accuracy of risk assessment and to identify possible interventions. This technique could be referred to as ‘A.I. neuroprediction,’ and involves identifying potential neurocognitive markers for the prediction of recidivism. However, the future implications of this technique and the role of neuroscience and A.I. in violence risk assessment remain to be established. In this paper, we review and analyze the literature concerning the use of brain-reading A.I. for neuroprediction of violence and rearrest to identify possibilities and challenges in the future use of these techniques in the fields of forensic psychiatry and criminal justice, considering legal implications and ethical issues. The analysis suggests that additional research is required on A.I. neuroprediction techniques, and there is still a great need to understand how they can be implemented in risk assessment in the field of forensic psychiatry. Besides the alluring potential of A.I. neuroprediction, we argue that its use in criminal justice and forensic psychiatry should be subjected to thorough harms/benefits analyses not only when these technologies will be fully available, but also while they are being researched and developed. © Copyright © 2020 Tortora, Meynen, Bijlsma, Tronci and Ferracuti.",artificial intelligence; forensic psychiatry; neurolaw; neuroprediction; recidivism; risk assessment

Much more rarely, there is consideration of the arousal and valence, affective behavior, emotional, and physiological states of possible buyers of green housing (AVABEPS) while they review the advertising. Yet, no integrated consideration of all these factors has been undertaken to date. The objective of this study was to consider, in an integrated manner, the AVABEPS, individual differences, and location impacts on property and desired residential unit features. During this research, the applications for the above data involved neuromarketing and multicriteria examination of video advertisements for diverse client segments by applying neuro decision tables. All of this can be performed by employing the method for planning and analyzing and by multiple criteria and customized video neuro-advertising green-housing variants (hereafter abbreviated as the ViNeRS Method), which the authors of this article have developed and present herein. The developed ViNeRS Method permits a compilation of as many as millions of alternative advertising variants. During the time of the ViNeRS project, we accumulated more than 350 million depersonalized AVABEPS data. The strong and average correlations determined in this research (over 35,000) and data examination by IBM SPSS tool support demonstrate the need to use AVABEPS in neuromarketing and neuro decision tables. The obtained dependencies constituted the basis for calculating and graphically submitting the ViNeRS circumplex model of affect, which the authors of this article developed. This model is similar to Russell’s well-known earlier circumplex model of affect. Real case studies with their related contextual conditions presented in this manuscript show a practical application of the ViNeRS Method. © 2020 by the authors.

The acknowledgment of outward appearances isn't a simple issue for AI techniques, since individuals can change altogether in the manner they demonstrate their looks. Indeed, even pictures of a similar individual in a similar outward appearance can shift in splendor, foundation and present, and these varieties are underscored if thinking about various subjects (due to varieties fit as a fiddle, ethnicity among others). Albeit outward appearance acknowledgment is contemplated in the writing, few works perform reasonable assessment abstaining from blending subjects while preparing and testing the proposed calculations. Thus, outward appearance acknowledgment is as yet a difficult issue in PC vision. In this work, we propose a straightforward answer for outward appearance acknowledgment that utilizes a blend of Convolutional Neural Network and explicit picture pre-handling steps. Convolutional Neural Networks accomplish better precision with huge information. Be that as it may, there are no openly accessible datasets with adequate information for outward appearance acknowledgment with profound structures. Subsequently, to handle the issue, we apply some pre-preparing systems to extricate just demeanour explicit highlights from a face picture and investigate the introduction request of the examples amid preparing. An investigation of the effect of each picture pre-preparing task in the precision rate is displayed. The proposed strategy: accomplishes aggressive outcomes when contrasted and other outward appearance acknowledgment techniques – going up to 92% precision - it is quick to prepare, and it takes into consideration ongoing outward appearance acknowledgment with standard PCs. © BEIESP.",Embedded vision system; MLP; Neural network; Territory saving projection

More recently, some have turned to the growing field of neuroscience to understand consumers. Neuromarketing employs brain imaging, scanning, or other brain measurement technologies to capture consumers’ (brain) responses to marketing stimuli and to circumvent the “problem” of relying on consumers’ self-reports. This paper presents findings of an ethnographic study of neuromarketing research practices in one neuromarketing consultancy. Our access to the minutiae of commercial neuromarketing research provides important insights into how neuromarketers silence the neuromarketing test subject in their experiments and presentations and how they introduce the brain as an unimpeachable witness. This enables us conceptually to reconsider the role of witnesses in the achievement of scientific credibility, as prominently discussed in science and technology studies (STS). Specifically, we probe the role witnesses and silences play in establishing and maintaining credibility in and for “commercial research laboratories.” We propose three themes that have wider relevance for STS researchers and require further attention when studying newly emerging research fields and practices that straddle science and its commercial application. © The Author(s) 2019.",academic disciplines and traditions; markets/economies; methodologies; methods; neuromarketing; neuroscience; witness

These emerging integrated technologies has contributed to the growth and understanding of the consumer decision making process. Several studies have attempted to evaluate media content, especially on video advertising or TV commercials using various neuroimaging techniques such as the electroencephalography (EEG) device. Currently, the use of neuroscience in Malaysia's marketing research is very limited due to its limited adoption as an emerging technology in this field. This research uncovers the neuroscientific approach, particularly through the use of an EEG device; examining consumers' responses in terms of brain wave signals and cognition. A proposed theoretical framework on the factors affecting visual stimulus (movement, color, shape, and light) during the decision-making process by watching video advertising had been customized using two conceptual models of sensory stimulation. Ten respondents participated in the experiment to investigate the spectral changes of alpha brain wave signals detected in the occipital lobe. A 2-channel Arduinobased EEG device from Backyard Brains and Spike Recorder software was used to analyze the EEG signal through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method. Results obtained from the investigated population showed that there was statistically significant brain wave activity during the observation of the video advertising which demonstrated the interconnection with short-term memory through visual stimulus. Application of the neuroscience tool helped to explore consumer brain responses towards marketing stimuli with regards to the consumers' decision-making processes. This study manifests a useful tool for neuromarketing and concludes with a discussion, together with recommendations on the way forward. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.",Arduino-based electroencephalography (EEG); Neuromarketing; Short-term memory; TV commercials; Visual cognition

It is also leading tourism companies to have to adapt their marketing strategies to different online social media. The present study analyzes advertising effectiveness in social media in terms of customers' visual attention and self-reported memory (recall). Data were collected through a within-subjects and between-groups design based on eye-tracking technology, followed by a self-administered questionnaire. Participants were instructed to visit three Travel 2.0 websites (T2W), including a hotel's blog, social network profile (Facebook), and virtual community profile (Tripadvisor). Overall, the results revealed greater advertising effectiveness in the case of the hotel social network; and visual attention measures based on eye-tracking data differed from measures of self-reported recall. Visual attention to the ad banner was paid at a low level of awareness, which explains why the associations with the ad did not activate its subsequent recall. The paper offers a pioneering attempt in the application of eye-tracking technology, and examines the possible impact of visual marketing stimuli on user T2W-related behavior. The practical implications identified in this research, along with its limitations and future research opportunities, are of interest both for further theoretical development and practical application. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Advertising effectiveness; Eye-tracking technology; Neuromarketing; Self-reported recall; Travel 2.0 websites

Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most frequently applied neuroscientific techniques for marketing studies, thanks to its low cost and high temporal resolution. Objective: We present an overview of EEG applications in consumer neuroscience. The aim of this review is to facilitate future research and to highlight reliable approaches for deriving research and managerial implications. Method: We conducted a systematic review by querying five databases for the titles of articles published up to June 2020 with the terms [EEG] AND [neuromarketing] OR [consumer neuroscience]. Results: We screened 264 abstracts and analyzed 113 articles, classified based on research topics (e.g., product characteristics, pricing, advertising attention and memorization, rational, and emotional messages) and characteristics of the experimental design (tasks, stimuli, participants, additional techniques). Conclusions: This review highlights the main applications of EEG to consumer neuroscience research and suggests several ways EEG technique can complement traditional experimental paradigms. Further research areas, including consumer profiling and social consumer neuroscience, have not been sufficiently explored yet and would benefit from EEG techniques to address unanswered questions. © Copyright © 2020 Bazzani, Ravaioli, Trieste, Faraguna and Turchetti.",consumer behavior; consumer neuroscience; decision-making; EEG; eletroencephalography; neuromarketing

Understanding the underlying mechanisms behind consumer shopping behaviors and the way that advertising affects such behavior are the most important issues that need more investigations. In this study, two purposes were focused including (1)the potential of EEG spectral power for prediction of consumers' preferences and (2)interpretation of the alteration of consumers' decision-making in shopping behavior when the content of an advertisement including background color and promotions was changed. For this purpose, advertisements related to different mobile phone brands which were different according to the content were shown to the participants followed by EEG (electroencephalography)recording. The power of the EEG data was used for finding the most important brain regions for distinguishing between preferences and predicting the incidence of decision-making. Furthermore, the results were used for interpretation of the observed participant behavior. The obtained results showed that the extracted features from EEG power could predict consumer's decision-making incidence with relatively high accuracy (>87%)and distinguished between “Like” and “Dislike” preferences with accuracy higher than 63%. Also, the most discriminative channels for predicting the incidence of decision-making about liking/disliking or buying a product were found to be frontal and Centro-parietal locations (Fp1, Cp3, Cpz)while the difference between “Like” and “Dislike” decisions was observed mostly in the frontal electrodes (F4 and Ft8). Furthermore, the results showed that adding the background color to the designed advertisement had a negative impact on the degree of liking a product. In conclusion, EEG data analysis can be used as a useful tool for predicting costumer decision-making, while in order to obtain higher accuracies, other features should be tested for distinguishing between different preferences. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Advertisement content; Decision-making; Electroencephalography (EEG); Neuromarketing; Preference prediction

This work presents an evaluation of different EEG time and frequency domain features within different brain regions of interest under the support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the research's goal to determine the best features and brain regions corresponding to the customer feelings. An online available dataset of 25 users', using a 14 channel EEG system, responses to 42 products is used. The outputs included two classes: like and dislike. The data is preprocessed by filtration, independent component analysis (ICA), principle component analysis (PCA) and normalization. Sixteen features/feature groups are derived from the preprocessed data using a window size of one-second and a total of four seconds of EEG signal. The features are then studied in an SVM classifier. The accuracy of the classification varied between the different features ranging between 60.71% for the Alpha power and 66.25% for the signal's slope sign change (SSC) feature using all channels. Further, the frontal lobe of the brain gave higher accuracy in comparison with the other regions, and the left frontal lobe was more dominant than the right frontal lobe in relation to the product preference decision. The results suggest an improvement in the classification accuracy when applying ICA and PCA. The left frontal lobe has the potential to classify user decisions for future simplified systems. © 2020 IEEE.",classification; EEG; ICA; neuromarketing; PCA; SVM; time domain features

One of the impressive results of this research has been the emergence of novel scientific disciplines (cognitive ergonomics and neuroergonomics, neuroeconomics, neuromarketing) and a whole class of technological contributions in medicine and related life sciences. In this country, the relevant studies are conducted within the Interregional Association for Cognitive Studies (IACS) on the basis of the National Research Center “Kurchatov Institute”. The authors of this article work in the Kurchatov Institute and represent the leadership of the IACS: Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences B.M. Velichkovsky — the founder and first president of this Association (2006–2010) and V.L. Ushakov — the current president of IACS since 2018. The article provides an overview of current neurocognitive research, combining fundamental issues with practical applications. The author describes the studies under way at the National Research Center “Kurchatov Institute” aimed at creating new types of humanmachine interfaces, which are intended to replace the traditional graphic interfaces created for users at early stages of cognitive science. These studies concentrate on visual attention and voluntary oculomotor behavior. The methods and results of exploring the macroscale brain mechanisms are presented. Modern methods, such as ultrafast functional magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic causal modeling, allow one to non-invasively reconstruct the picture of cause-effect interactions in the human brain both at rest and at solving various tasks. Using these methods, it became possible, for the first time, to investigate the interaction between different brain mechanisms attributed to different evolutionary levels of its organization, namely, the oldest, old, new and newest cortex. An example of the first is the hippocampus, and that of the newest is the front-polar areas of the frontal lobes. As a result, new data on the asymmetry of the human brain in health and disease were obtained, indicating the importance of the interhemispheric asymmetry and the right hemisphere dominance over the effective (cause-effect) connections during normal functioning of the brain and consciousness at rest. The authors emphasize that the macroscale organization can and should be studied in the context of molecular mechanisms of the respective neural networks in the human brain. The expression of protein-encoding genes in the frontal-polar regions of the cortex is presented. In this study, the right-sided dominance was also found but this time regarding the number of expressed genes associated with the risk of schizophrenia. However, no association with major neurodegenerative diseases was found. Diagnosis of consciousness has always played an important role in medicine. To date, a communicative contact with the patient remains the main test of the consciousness integrity. Along with that, the significance of objective methods is growing. There are arguments that the modeling of consciousness and the respective implementation are the most important factors of further progress in the area of cognitive technologies and machine “intelligence”. © 2019, Privolzhsky Research Medical University.

It has spawned new insights in multiple cutting-edge fields, such as consumer neuroscience, neuromarketing, neuroIS, and organizational neuroscience, thereby promoting the paradigm of management science from subjective to objective. Among these fields, consumer neuroscience can better understand consumer behavior and the motivations behind it. This article reviews the latest progresses pertaining to consumer behavior prediction in the perspective of consumer neuroscience. Specifically, it summarizes how neuroscience can be implemented in forecasting consumer behavior, as well as limitations and future research potentials. The article sets out from a brief introduction of the theoretically basis of consumer behavior prediction - the discovery of neural correlates that relates to consumer behavior. For example, the striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) are related to “reward”; the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is related to “subjective value”; and the mesencephalic limbic system is closely related to individual value perception. These findings unveil the neural “black box” behind consumer behavior, thereby laying a solid foundation for consumer behavior prediction. Consequently, they shed lights on the neural indicators that relate to consumer behavior, which help to interpret consumer behavior more accurately. Moreover, they also reveal that neural data can be the viable predictor for consumers' individual and market behaviors. Thus, consumer neuroscience not only enriches the decision theory, but also promotes the application of theory. Next, the article moves on to illustrate the methods in consumer behavior prediction with traditional methods and neuroscience tools. Traditional methods include qualitative methods like interviews and focus groups, quantitative methods like surveys, experimental studies, big data and artificial intelligence. Neuroscience tools include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye tracking, and some physiological and biological metrics like skin electrical response, heart rate, respiratory rate, etc. Among them, fMRI and fNIRS can locate brain regions related to specific functions; EEG records cortical potential when engaged in specific tasks; eye tracking is mainly used to record the eye movement; skin electrical response, heart rate, and respiratory rate can reflect the level of affect and emotion. Compared with traditional methods, neuroscience tools complement their alternatives such as predicting with laboratory behavioral data and show superiority to predict the overall market consumption. Then, this article demonstrates the recent trends of consumer behavior prediction research based on consumer neuroscience perspective. With the rapid development of consumer neuroscience, the research trend of consumer behavior prediction emerged and fluctuated in the last decade. Currently, it pioneers in consumer neuroscience. We summarize 18 representative researches regarding to their research tools, topics, measurement indicators, published journals, and then detail the research status of predicting consumer behavior. In related researches, fMRI predicts for consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference, product selection and advertising performance. It usually applies to occasions where the brain area has been clearly associated with specific behaviors; EEG is mostly used to predict consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference and product selection. It applies to occasions where the stimuli is time-dynamic (e.g., video ads, movies, TV programs, etc.); eye tracking is mostly used to predict product selection behavior when studying consumer behavior related to visual attention; and other neuroscience tools for consumer behavior predication is also introduced. Lastly, this article points out the limitations in this vein of research based on the summary of previous studies. It states that a lack of specific cognitive indicators to predict consumer behavior, rare measure in real scenes, ethical issues need further discussion. In particular, domestic research is in its infancy and still has a large space for development. Then we put forward the directions that need to be broken in the future based on the current bottlenecks. (1) Combine multi-modal data to enrich unique indicators for predicting consumer behavior; (2) Predict consumer behavior from multiple stages of purchase decisions based on real-life needs; (3) Optimize data collection and analysis methods to improve the external validity; (4) Conduct cross-cultural research to reveal consumption forecast in domestic context. The rapid growth of neuroscience tools ushers in an era of consumer neuroscience. Consumer neuroscience researches are then equipped with more objective metrics to advance research in marketing researches. It supplements the earlier controversial researches and provides unlimited possibilities for the future development. In the future, the strand of consumer neuroscience will be closely integrated with emerging disciplines such as big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to develop richer research fields, attract more professional researchers, and apply more humane research tools, thereby providing more theoretical and pragmatic values for consumer behavior research. © 2020.

The ability to correctly identify likes and dislikes as well as excitement and boredom would facilitate novel applications in neuromarketing, affective entertainment, virtual rehabilitation and forensic neuroscience that leverage on sub-conscious human affective states. In this neuroinformatics investigation, we seek to recognize human preferences and excitement passively through the use of electroencephalography (EEG) when a subject is presented with some 3D visual stimuli. Our approach employs the use of machine learning in the form of deep neural networks to classify brain signals acquired using a brain-computer interface (BCI). In the first part of our study, we attempt to improve upon our previous work, which has shown that EEG preference classification is possible although accuracy rates remain relatively low at 61%-67% using conventional deep learning neural architectures, where the challenge mainly lies in the accurate classification of unseen data from a cohort-wide sample that introduces inter-subject variability on top of the existing intra-subject variability. Such an approach is significantly more challenging and is known as subject-independent EEG classification as opposed to the more commonly adopted but more time-consuming and less general approach of subject-dependent EEG classification. In this new study, we employ deep networks that allow dropouts to occur in the architecture of the neural network. The results obtained through this simple feature modification achieved a classification accuracy of up to 79%. Therefore, this study has shown that the use of a deep learning classifier was able to achieve an increase in emotion classification accuracy of between 13% and 18% through the simple adoption of the use of dropouts compared to a conventional deep learner for EEG preference classification. In the second part of our study, users are exposed to a roller-coaster experience as the emotional stimuli which are expected to evoke the emotion of excitement, while simultaneously wearing virtual reality goggles, which delivers the virtual reality experience of excitement, and an EEG headset, acquires the raw brain signals detected when exposed to this excitement stimuli. Here, a deep learning approach is used to improve the excitement detection rate to well above the 90% accuracy level. In a prior similar study, the use of conventional machine learning approaches involving k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM) only achieved prediction accuracy rates of between 65% and 89%. Using a deep learning approach here, rates of 78%-96% were achieved. This demonstrates the superiority of adopting a deep learning approach over other machine learning approaches for detecting human excitement when immersed in an immersive virtual reality environment. © 2015 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.",Deep learning; Dropouts; Electroencephalography (EEG); Emotion classification; Excitement classification; Neuroinformatics; Preference classification; Virtual reality

Most state-of-the-art techniques focus primarily on visible spectrum information for emotion recognition. This becomes very arduous as emotions of individuals vary significantly. Moreover, visible images are susceptible to variation in illumination. Low lighting, variation in poses, aging, and disguise have a substantial impact on the appearance of images and textural information. Even though great advances have been made in the field, facial emotion recognition using existing techniques is often not satisfactory when compared to human performance. To overcome these shortcomings, thermal images are preferred to visible images. Thermal images a) are less sensitive to lighting conditions, b) have consistent thermal signatures, and c) have a temperature distribution formed by the face vein branches. This paper proposes a robust emotion recognition system using thermal images- TERNet. To accomplish this, customized convolutional neural network(CNNs) is employed, which possess excellent generalization capabilities. The architecture adopts features obtained via transfer learning from the VGG-Face CNN model, which is further fine-tuned with the thermal expression face data from the TUFTS face database.

With the technological changes and developments in the last 15 years, advertising communication has evolved substantially to adapt to the new media arising in the digital environment. Thus not only the media have transformed but, consubstantially, the means of communicating, objectives and ways have evolved. This scenario has led to the emergence of various, apparently antagonistic, advertising trends. We can see the rise in new vintage trends that recover what is artisan and handmade, while campaigns are developed with increasingly technological applications (bots and new artificial intelligence, for example). These include a great tendency towards scientific and pseudoscientific justification. This not only involves applying neuromarketing to sales environments, but rather recovering old product demonstrations with brand values or understanding the insights applied to a creative concept. Advertising creativity recovered old psychological experiments used in the '60s and '70s, such as the marshmallow experiment, applying them to new creative proposals in special actions. In this way, psychological and sociological advertising experiments find a new way of using the product “demonstration”, or a “scientific” argument for the purchase, creating a brand image or promoting a change in attitude. This text analyses the most representative examples of this recently extended practice in order to analyze their characteristics, conceptualization and audiovisual production, so as to better understand the mechanisms used by the advertising sector to persuade and convince about certain changes in attitude. © 2018, University of La Laguna.

The experiments are performed on the subject by attaching electrodes to certain areas of the head. The electrodes are connected to the brain sensor and the outcomes are processed by the Arduino processor, which utilizes an interface to show the output as electrical activity in the brain. Two hundred samples were taken in each subject in two conditions, namely deep sleep and awake while listening to music to determine the pattern of electrical activity for each alpha, beta, theta, delta and gamma wave. Based on the test results, there are significant differences in the waves by the subjects' conditions.

Medical diagnostic devices for brain imaging are utilized by marketers as neuromarketing technologies. This paper proposes a fuzzy scenario-based approach to analyzing neuromarketing technology evaluation criteria. Fuzzy cognitive map methodology, which is originated from the combination of fuzzy logic and neural networks, is employed due to the cause-and-effect relationships between pair of factors, presence of conflicting criteria, positive as well as negative relationships among factors, and lack of crisp data. Importance degrees of each evaluation factor are computed, and then, four different scenario analyses are provided to understand the influence of an increase or a decrease in the power of specific factor(s) on other factors.

Wavelet coherence (WC) and phase difference (PD) were used for investigating how the marketing stimuli induced the degree of information flow occurs between electrodes of EEG. Pulse rate variability (PRV) obtained from finger PPG and computed the powers in high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF). The powers in the LF and HF bands are regulated by Autonomic nervous systems (ANS) and then, Skin conductance level (SCL) computed from GSR by measuring changes in the conductivity of the skin. These electrophysiological measurements computed to evaluate emotional stress. The signals were recorded simultaneously from 30 subjects for two stages: prior to advertising stimuli (control stage) and during the advertising stimuli (experimental stage) using iMotions system in Uskudar University (Istanbul, Turkey). The WC and PD for each electrode pairs were computed for five frequency sub-bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) of EEG. While the value of WC was generally higher in experimental stage than control stage especially in the theta, alpha and beta frequency, the value of PD was generally lower especially in gamma band. An increase of interhemispheric coherence in experimental stage occurred in the anterior frontal -temporal-parietal- area. At the same time, the LF/HF ratio and SCL were generally higher in experimental stage. We investigated whether there were statistically significant differences in WC, PD, the LF/HF ratio and SCL between the experimental and control stage. Results were demonstrated significant differences in WC and PD, LF/HF ratio between experimental stage and control stage, but there was not in SCL. © 2019, Anka Publishers.

However, business practice as expressed in the ANA (2013) study demands more sophisticated sponsorship evaluation approaches that currently incorporate (a) the application of additional measurement instruments, especially from the area of neuromarketing and (b) the analysis of various customer and spectator perspectives, e.g., fan vs. anti-fan in the context of rivalry. With regard to the latter, Madrigal and Dalakas (2008) reviewed that the nature of fan behavior ranges from socially acceptable reactions to negative inappropriate reactions. However, there is only little research explaining how affective dispositions of fans and anti-fans determine the effectiveness of sport sponsorship outcomes such as association transfers from the sponsored entity (e.g., a football team) to the sponsor brand. The sweetness and spiciness of rivalry nurtures media’s and public’s awareness and gets them geared up for an ongoing competitive contest (Stead 2008; Whitson 1998). In the light of the relevance of rivalry as a key element for a high viewer attraction in sports (Kimble and Cooper 1992; Mahony and Moorman 1999) and with reference to Cornwell (2008), the present study partially fills the gap of empirical research in general and empirical evidence in particular related to the measurement of sports sponsorship impact. Particularly, the current research relies on an adapted implicit association test (IAT; Greenwald et al. 1998) from cognitive psychology and widely applied in neuromarketing to better understand consumer’s automatic and spontaneous responses, the so-called implicit processes, to marketing stimuli (e.g., Dimofte 2010: Horcajo et al. 2010). Specifically, the effect of team sponsorship on explicit and implicit brand-related information processing from a fan rivalry perspective is addressed. The empirical results of the presented study suggest that team sponsorship has an impact on implicit and explicit brand information processing. However, a significant positive impact on both dual processes was only revealed within the group of fans, whereas within the group of non-fans only negative implicit and explicit association changes could be identified. In sum, sport spectators’ feelings in terms of affective dispositions toward a sponsored subject or object in a rival competition are of high relevance for the marketing management of the sponsor brand (e.g., Tyler and Cobbs 2015). Particularly, affective dispositions are often related with positive reactions such as favoritism (e.g., Gwinner and Swanson 2003) and a potentially positive association transfer as well as with negative reactions such as aggression (e.g., Wann et al. 2015) which might lead to a negative association transfer. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.",Consumer information processing; Implicit measures; Reaction time measurement; Sport rivalry; Sports sponsorship

In this new communication and connecting environment, companies are under pressure to constantly adapt and become present on platforms where their customers are while being sustainable and profitable in the long run. On the other hand, traditional marketing research challenges have led to the expansion of new research approaches like neuromarketing as a means to gather the most accurate data ever from customers. When referring to how we can use neuromarketing research within the social media context, the current paper aims to fill a gap in the current literature: Using neuromarketing research in social media while taking into consideration both companies' purposes and customers' sought-after benefits. This aim is achieved through two pieces of research that shed light on a model where these purposes are matched with the corresponding benefits, showing the degree of acceptability of four major neuromarketing applications. This model is a stepping stone towards discovering how social media neuromarketing research can be a pillar of sustainable business communication as part of the broader perspective of sustainability in terms of business growth. © 2019 by the authors.",Neuromarketing; Quantitative marketing research; Social media; Sustainable communication

We were looking for left hemispheric dominance, which according to the adopted theoretical model, indicated approach reactions of respondents to incoming stimulation. We have found that dominant reactions were present only in response to one of the tested ads - ""Balls"" Target group respondents reacted in such way to emotional part of the ad, as well as to its informational part (including product-benefit, product, and brand exposure scenes). No similar pattern was found for the remaining two ads.

In doing so, models of consumer choice and communication effects that were originally conceived during a non-neuroscience psychology era should now be challenged with the recent and plentiful advances that neurobiology has made in reshaping our understanding of the human mind and decision-making processes. This study aims at providing an update of exactly these updates, and to use this novel understanding to challenge a dominating category of consumer choice and communication effects, going under the headings such as “response hierarchy models”. By using examples of these models, we will demonstrate that even the basic assumptions in these models need to be reconsidered, and that the overall tenants of the models are equally problematic. Based on our overall understanding and an in-depth analysis of the modern neurobiological basis of decision-making in humans, it can be concluded that AIDA model is not applicable and substantially problematic. Therefore, it can be asserted that a reframing of the model needs to encompass both conscious and unconscious streams of action. Consequently, the model shall consider massively parallel systems, where A, I, D and A have two parallel systems, a conscious and an unconscious. The conscious system must only occur for certain level of unconscious process, whereas unconscious processes can occur without the necessity of consciousness. The reframed model suggested in this study can be the interest of both scholars and practitioners. © 2017 The Author(s).

In this study, we demonstrate the application of this framework to neuromarketing by predicting purchase decisions from spatio-temporal fMRI data. A sample of 24 subjects were shown product images and asked to make decisions of whether to buy them or not while undergoing fMRI scanning. Eight brain regions which were significantly activated during decision-making were identified using a general linear model. Time series were extracted from these regions and input into a recursive cluster elimination based support vector machine (RCE-SVM) for predicting purchase decisions. This method iteratively eliminates features which are unimportant until only the most discriminative features giving maximum accuracy are obtained. We were able to predict purchase decisions with 71% accuracy, which is higher than previously reported. In addition, we found that the most discriminative features were in signals from medial and superior frontal cortices. Therefore, this approach provides a reliable framework for using fMRI data to predict purchase-related decision-making as well as infer its neural correlates. © 2009-2011 IEEE.",Accuracy; Feature extraction; Magnetic resonance imaging; Prediction algorithms; Support vector machines; Testing; Time series analysis

The basic aim is to guide design and presentation of products to optimize them to be as compatible as possible with consumer preferences. This paper investigates physiological decision processes while participants undertook a choice task designed to elicit preferences for a product. The task required participants to choose their preferred crackers described by shape (square, triangle, round), flavor (wheat, dark rye, plain) and topping (salt, poppy, no topping). The two main research objectives were (1) to observe and evaluate the cortical activity of the different brain regions and the interdependencies among the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from these regions; and (2) unlike most research in this area that has focused mainly on liking/disliking certain products, we provide a way to quantify the importance of different cracker features that contribute to the product design based on mutual information. We used the commercial Emotiv EPOC wireless EEG headset with 14 channels to collect EEG signals from participants. We also used a Tobii-Studio eye tracker system to relate the EEG data to the specific choice options (crackers). Subjects were shown 57 choice sets; each choice set described three choice options (crackers). The patterns of cortical activity were obtained in the five principal frequency bands, Delta (0-4 Hz), Theta (3-7 Hz), Alpha (8-12 Hz), Beta (13-30 Hz), and Gamma (30-40 Hz). There was a clear phase synchronization between the left and right frontal and occipital regions indicating interhemispheric communications during the chosen task for the 18 participants. Results also indicated that there was a clear and significant change (p < 0.01) in the EEG power spectral activities taking a place mainly in the frontal (delta, alpha and beta across F3, F4, FC5 and FC6), temporal (alpha, beta, gamma across T7), and occipital (theta, alpha, and beta across O1) regions when participants indicated their preferences for their preferred crackers. Additionally, our mutual information analysis indicated that the various cracker flavors and toppings of the crackers were more important factors affecting the buying decision than the shapes of the crackers. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, music is an ecologically valid and complex stimulus that conveys certain emotions to listeners through compositions of musical elements. Using solely EEG signals to distinguish emotions remained challenging. This study aimed to assess the applicability of a multimodal approach by leveraging the EEG dynamics and acoustic characteristics of musical contents for the classification of emotional valence and arousal. To this end, this study adopted machine-learning methods to systematically elucidate the roles of the EEG and music modalities in the emotion modeling. The empirical results suggested that when whole-head EEG signals were available, the inclusion of musical contents did not improve the classification performance. The obtained performance of 74~76% using solely EEG modality was statistically comparable to that using the multimodality approach. However, if EEG dynamics were only available from a small set of electrodes (likely the case in real-life applications), the music modality would play a complementary role and augment the EEG results from around 61-67% in valence classification and from around 58-67% in arousal classification. The musical timber appeared to replace less-discriminative EEG features and led to improvements in both valence and arousal classification, whereas musical loudness was contributed specifically to the arousal classification. The present study not only provided principles for constructing an EEG-based multimodal approach, but also revealed the fundamental insights into the interplay of the brain activity and musical contents in emotion modeling. © 2014 Lin, Yang and Jung.",Affective brain-computer interface; EEG; Emotion classification; Music listening; Music signal processing

Market research is facing new challenges with the introduction of new forms of approach to consumer behavior. The new field that emerged as neuromarketing might become a linchpin in leading innovation in this field. The pure rational consumer is being questioned and emotions are playing a central role in any marketing strategy. Traditional market research methods have demonstrated some inconvenience to gather reliable data and neuromarketing is opening new possibilities to marketing professionals using new methods to delve into personal emotions, stronger than the classical ones. In this sense and although some of the neuroimaging techniques are used in other disciplines, the application to market research is growing rapidly and providing a new perspective and contributing to better understand and predict consumer behavior. Nowadays, consumers have more information than ever before. Consumer’s mind is uncontrollable. From marketing perspective, neuromarketing is becoming mainstream but can’t be done at the expense of privacy, neither consumer’s free will. Over the last decade, neuroethics arose as a way to draw the attention concerning the use of techniques involving brain research. Academia and companies need to comply ethical procedures and legal protocols while conducting neuromarketing research. This chapter wants to shed some light on important topics such as ethical issues involving participants in neuromarketing research, consumers that experience the outcomes of such studies, and also researchers that conduct them. Neuromarketing, as a new discipline, is expected to face exciting challenges in the near future. Improving neuroethics, privacy, and confidentiality inherent to research subjects while conducting research are no doubt some of them. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Confidentiality; Neuroethics; Neuromarketing; Privacy; Research subject

There has been an inclination to refer to the intersection of these technologies with the general topic of marketing as “neuromarketing”. There has not been a serious effort to frame neuromarketing, which is the goal of this paper. Neuromarketing can be compared to neuroeconomics, wherein neuroeconomics is generally focused on how individuals make “choices”, and represent distributions of choices. Neuromarketing, in contrast, focuses on how a distribution of choices can be shifted or “influenced”, which can occur at multiple “scales” of behavior (e.g., individual, group, or market/society). Given influence can affect choice through many cognitive modalities, and not just that of valuation of choice options, a science of influence also implies a need to develop a model of cognitive function integrating attention, memory, and reward/aversion function. The paper concludes with a brief description of three domains of neuromarketing application for studying influence, and their caveats. © 2015 Breiter, Block, Blood, Calder, Chamberlain, Lee, Livengood, Mulhern, Raman, Schultz, Stern, Viswanathan and Zhang.",Choice; Influence; Marketing communications; Neuroeconomics; Neuroimaging; Neuromarketing; Scaling

Indeed, new scientific fields have been appearing for a few years around brain activity and have been developed using brain imaging: neuroergonomics, neuromarketing and neuroaesthetics. The literature distinguishes two fields of research: - The replacement of motor and cognitive functions: In this first category of research, humans are assisted by technology (computing and mechanics), which substitutes motor and/or cognitive actions with cerebral responses in order to compensate the effects of sensory or motor disorders. Brain imaging is therefore used to modify and improve human activity. - The construction of new knowledge about human beings: This second category concerns the interpretation of brain imaging in order to understand human beings (i.e. mental or social processes) without disturbing the subject's activity (driving, shopping, working...). Our objective is to present a review of this research but also to set a prospective framework for using brain imaging in product design in order to overcome the limits of existing methods and improve the evaluation of products or concepts with more objective results.

With the use of advanced EEG/MEG recording setup involving hundred of sensors, the issue of the protection against the type I errors that could occur during the execution of hundred of univariate statistical tests, has gained interest. In the present experiment, we investigated the EEG signals from a mannequin acting as an experimental subject. Data have been collected while performing a neuromarketing experiment and analyzed with state of the art computational tools adopted in specialized literature. Results showed that electric data from the mannequin's head presents statistical significant differences in power spectra during the visualization of a commercial advertising when compared to the power spectra gathered during a documentary, when no adjustments were made on the alpha level of the multiple univariate tests performed. The use of the Bonferroni or Bonferroni-Holm adjustments returned correctly no differences between the signals gathered from the mannequin in the two experimental conditions. An partial sample of recently published literature on different neuroscience journals suggested that at least the 30% of the papers do not use statistical protection for the type I errors. While the occurrence of type I errors could be easily managed with appropriate statistical techniques, the use of such techniques is still not so largely adopted in the literature. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Bonferroni adjustment; False discovery rate; Inverse problem; Neuromarketing; Statistical mapping; Type I errors

Such a representation can be used to characterize the emotional content of video clips in application areas such as affective video indexing and retrieval, and neuromarketing studies. A dataset of 64 different scenes from eight movies was shown to eight participants. While watching these scenes, their physiological responses were recorded. The participants were asked to self-assess their felt emotional arousal and valence for each scene. In addition, content-based audio-and video-based features were extracted from the movie scenes in order to characterize each scene. Degrees of arousal and valence were estimated by a linear combination of features from physiological signals, as well as by a linear combination of content-based features. We showed that a significant correlation exists between valence-arousal provided by the spectator's self-assessments, and affective grades obtained automatically from either physiological responses or from audio-video features. By means of an analysis of variance (ANOVA), the variation of different participants' self assessments and different gender groups self assessments for both valence and arousal were shown to be significant (p-values lower than 0.005).

This essentially leads to increase in profit to a manufacturing unit. Re-production of products usually depends on the various facts including consumption in the market, reviewer’s comments, ratings, etc. However, knowing consumer preference for decision making and behavior prediction for effective utilization of a product using unconscious processes is called “Neuromarketing”. This field is emerging fast due to its inherent potential. Therefore, research work in this direction is highly demanded, yet not reached a satisfactory level. In this paper, we propose a predictive modeling framework to understand consumer choice towards E-commerce products in terms of “likes” and “dislikes” by analyzing EEG signals. The EEG signals of volunteers with varying age and gender were recorded while they browsed through various consumer products. The experiments were performed on the dataset comprised of various consumer products. The accuracy of choice prediction was recorded using a user-independent testing approach with the help of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classifier.

The success rate of such new products directly influences a retailer's success in terms of gross profit, customer loyalty and brand image. In the past decades, many self-report and focus group based methods were implemented to gain insights in future market performance of new products. However, social psychology and market research studies have established that self-reports are unreliable to accurately predict customer preference. In this article, we propose a novel approach based on brain data to forecast product performance and discuss the importance of pre-market forecasting in the footwear retailing industry. We implemented and validated the tool in collaboration with a European shoe store chain. This case study showed that self-report based methods cannot accurately foretell success, while using brain data the prediction accuracy reached 80 per cent. We also compared how these two different methods might influence company gross profit. Simulations based on sales data showed that self-report based prediction would lead to a 12.1 per cent profit growth, while brain scan based prediction would increase profit by 36.4 per cent.

We will show which kind of information is possible to gather with these methodologies while persons are watching marketing relevant stimuli. Such information is related to the memorization and attention of commercial advertisements. We noted that temporal and frequency patterns of EEG signals are able to return descriptors of cognitive process in subjects that watched such commercial announcements. The described EEG methodologies could be then employed both to better design new products that are going to be promoted on the market as well as to analyse the global cognitive impact of commercial videos already broadcasted.",Attention; EEG; Memory; Neuromarketing

Recent technological developments in hard- and software solutions to measure brain and body reactions have led to promising opportunities for practitioners and academics in the field of marketing. Besides the developments’ potential advantages, the commercial perspective of neuromarketing raises several ethical questions. Marketing practitioners need to be aware of the ethical aspects that the different tools, like eye tracking, EEG, and fMRI, imply when they conduct a neuromarketing study. Since recent guidelines deliver rather general instructions and are limited in their tool-specific perspective, the development of a comprehensive guideline for conducting ethically correct neuromarketing is imperative. In past years some codes have emerged, but to date no substantial ethical framework meeting academic and business standards as well as questions related to different tools has been developed. The aim of this chapter is to shed light on existing ethical guidelines with respect to tool-based distinctions in order to provide reliable answers for both academics and marketing practitioners. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Code of conduct; Consumer neuroscience; Neuromarketing; NMSBA; Research conduct; Scientific validity

A prominent example of this trend is neuromarketing - a relatively new form of market and consumer research that applies neuroscience to marketing by employing brain imaging or measurement technology to anticipate consumers' response to, for instance, products, packaging or advertising. In this paper, we draw attention to the ways in which certain neuromarketing technologies simultaneously reveal and enact a particular version of the consumer. The revelation is ironic in the sense that it entails the construction of a contrast between what appears to be the case - consumers' accounts of why they prefer certain products over others - and what can be shown to be the case as a result of the application of the technology - the hidden or concealed truth. This contrast structure characterises much of the academic and popular literature on neuromarketing, and helps explain the distribution of accountability relations associated with assessments of its effectiveness. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",accountability; consumers; market research; neuromarketing; science and technology studies; technologies of ironic revelation

We propose that there are two main reasons for this trend. First, the possibility that neuroimaging will become cheaper and faster than other marketing methods; and second, the hope that neuroimaging will provide marketers with information that is not obtainable through conventional marketing methods. Although neuroimaging is unlikely to be cheaper than other tools in the near future, there is growing evidence that it may provide hidden information about the consumer experience. The most promising application of neuroimaging methods to marketing may come before a product is even released when it is just an idea being developed. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Neuromarketing is founded on the assumption that individual sensory and motor systems can be identified in specific networks of brain cells, the observation of which can reveal the unconscious or emotional characteristics of consumer decision making. Yet, neuromarketing technologies present several limitations that can impede the extension and validation of their application: (i) the development of high-priced and time-restricted neuroimaging experiments; (ii) the employment of large and immovable devices confined to artificial laboratory environments; (iii) the use of a single neuroimaging technology at a time (usually the functional magnetic resonance imaging); (iv) the use of a single nonneuroimaging device at a time; and (v) the potentially unethical manipulation of research subjects. One way to address these issues involves nanotechnologies, which present a ground-breaking opportunity for neuromarketing research. These technologies encompass not only the traditional notion of structures, devices, and systems created by limiting shape and size at the nanometer scale, but also the new miniaturized tools based on one or more nanocomponents. The integration of neuromarketing and nanotechnologies could start a new field of research, which is termed here nanomarketing. Nanomarketing makes it possible to: (i) carry out noninvasive and nonintrusive experiments in shopping places; (ii) monitor consumers’ mental processes in real time; (iii) combine different technologies to corroborate results obtained by different neuroscientific tools; (iv) integrate neurophysiological field indicators with laboratory neuroimaging results; and (v) highlight ethical issues raised by the use of these novel, portable, and easy-to-use nanodevices. This study thus has a twofold aim: (i) investigating both the limitations and opportunities, for researchers and practitioners, that accompany the miniaturization process and application of nanotechnologies to neuromarketing; and (ii) providing a critical review of the aforementioned limitations, highlighting the theoretical and managerial implications, and summarizing the discussion for future research. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Design/methodology/approach – A critical approach to investigate three methodological issues related to fMRI applications in marketing is adopted. These issues deal mainly with brain activation regions, event-related fMRI and signal-to-noise ratio. Statistical issues related to fMRI data pre-processing, analyzing and reporting are also investigated. Findings – Neuroimaging cognitive techniques have great potential in marketing and advertising. This is because, unlike conventional marketing research methods, neuroimaging data are much less susceptible to social desirability and “interviewer’s” effect. Thus, it is expected that using neuroimaging methods to investigate which areas in a consumer’s brain are activated in response to a specific marketing stimulus can provide a much more honest indicator of their cognition compared to traditional marketing research tools such as focus groups and questionnaires. Originality/value – By merging disparate fields, such as marketing, neuroscience and cognitive psychology, this research presents a comprehensive critical review of how neuroscientific methods can be used to test existing marketing theories. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",fMRI; Functional neuroanatomy; Neuromarketing; Statistical parametric maps

These public discussions have generally centered around potential ethical aspects and the public fear of negative consequences for society in general, and consumers in particular. However, positive contributions to the scientific discourse from developing a biological model that tries to explain context-situated human behavior such as consumption have often been neglected. We argue for a differentiated terminology, naming commercial applications of neuroscientific methods 'neuromarketing' and scientific ones 'consumer neuroscience'. While marketing scholars have eagerly integrated neuroscientific evidence into their theoretical framework, neurology has only recently started to draw its attention to the results of consumer neuroscience.Discussion: In this paper we address key research topics of consumer neuroscience that we think are of interest for neurologists; namely the reward system, trust and ethical issues. We argue that there are overlapping research topics in neurology and consumer neuroscience where both sides can profit from collaboration. Further, neurologists joining the public discussion of ethical issues surrounding neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience could contribute standards and experience gained in clinical research.Summary: We identify the following areas where consumer neuroscience could contribute to the field of neurology:. First, studies using game paradigms could help to gain further insights into the underlying pathophysiology of pathological gambling in Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, epilepsy, and Huntington's disease.Second, we identify compulsive buying as a common interest in neurology and consumer neuroscience. Paradigms commonly used in consumer neuroscience could be applied to patients suffering from Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal dementia to advance knowledge of this important behavioral symptom.Third, trust research in the medical context lacks empirical behavioral and neuroscientific evidence. Neurologists entering this field of research could profit from the extensive knowledge of the biological foundation of trust that scientists in economically-orientated neurosciences have gained.Fourth, neurologists could contribute significantly to the ethical debate about invasive methods in neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience. Further, neurologists should investigate biological and behavioral reactions of neurological patients to marketing and advertising measures, as they could show special consumer vulnerability and be subject to target marketing. © 2013 Javor et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Compulsive buying; Consumer neuroscience; Ethics; Neurology; Neuromarketing; Pathological gambling; Reward; Trust

These technologies have been used in medicine and economics and for decision-making in business, thereby leading to the emergence of new fields of neuroeconomics and neuromarketing. In the current study, we investigate the possibility that brain activity distinguishes unfamiliar information. Typical applications are that a user who encounters unfamiliar information while browsing a website can automatically obtain the details of this information through BCIs without having to perform a web search. In this study, we use near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system that acquires data in real time in order to measure brain activity. The results of our experiment indicated that our proposed method allows for the distinguishing of unfamiliar information with about 80% accuracy, as demonstrated in the performance of 60 tasks. So, it is indeed possible to develop a BCI that can distinguish unfamiliar information. © 2012 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.",Brain-computer interface; Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS); Neuromarketing; Single-trial classification

The recognition of facial expressions is not an easy problem for machine learning methods, since different people can vary in the way that they show their expressions. And even an image of the same person in one expression can vary in brightness, background and position. Therefore, facial expression recognition is still a challenging problem in computer vision. In this work, we propose a simple solution for facial expression recognition that uses a combination of standard methods, like Convolutional Network and specific image pre-processing steps. Convolutional networks, and the most machine learning methods, achieve better accuracy depending on a given feature set. Therefore, a study of some image pre-processing operations that extract only expression specific features of a face image is also presented. The experiments were carried out using a largely used public database for this problem. A study of the impact of each image pre-processing operation in the accuracy rate is presented. To the best of our knowledge, our method achieves the best result in the literature, 97.81% of accuracy, and takes less time to train than state-of-the-art methods. © 2015 IEEE.",Computer Vision; Convolutional Networks; Expression Specific Features; Facial Expression; Machine Learning

The performances of functional magnetic resonance imaging are not limited to medical research and are used in non-medical fields. These recent applications represent new challenges for bioethics. Objective. - In this article we aim at discussing the new ethical issues raised by the applications of the latest neuroimaging technologies to non-medical fields. Methods. -We included a selection of peer-reviewed English medical articles after a search on NCBI Pubmed database and Google scholar from 2000 to 2013. We screened bibliographical tables for supplementary references. Websites of governmental French institutions implicated in ethical questions were also screened for governmental reports. Results. - Findings of brain areas supporting emotional responses and regulation have been used for marketing research, also called neuromarketing. The discovery of different brain activation patterns in antisocial disorder has led to changes in forensic psychiatry with the use of imaging techniques with unproven validity. Automated classification algorithms and multivariate statistical analyses of brain images have been applied to brain-reading techniques, aiming at predicting unconscious neural processes in humans. We finally report the current position of the French legislation recently revised and discuss the technical limits of such techniques. Discussion. - In the near future, brain imaging could find clinical applications in psychiatry as diagnostic or predictive tools. However, the latest advances in brain imaging are also used in non-scientific fields raising key ethical questions. Involvement of neuroscientists, psychiatrists, physicians but also of citizens in neuroethics discussions is crucial to challenge the risk of unregulated uses of brain imaging. © 2014 L'Encéphale, Paris.",Ethics; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neuroscience; Psychiatry

Since this nascent field is primarily concerned with improving marketing strategies and promoting sales, there has been an increasing public aversion and protest against it. These protests can be exemplified by the reactions observed lately in Baylor School of Medicine and Emory University in the United States. The most recent attempt to stop ongoing neuromarketing research in France is also remarkable. The pertaining ethical issues have been continuously attracting much attention, especially since the number of neuromarketing companies has exceeded 300 world-wide. This paper begins with a brief introduction to the field of neurotechnology by presenting its current capabilities and limitations. Then, it will focus on the ethical issues and debates most related with the recent applications of this technology. The French Parliament’s revision of rules on bioethics in 2004 has an exemplary role in our discussion. The proposal by Murphy et al. (2008) has attracted attention to the necessity of ethical codes structuring this field. A code has recently been declared by the Neuromarketing Science and Business Association. In this paper, it is argued that these technologies should be sufficiently discussed in public spheres and its use on humans should be fully carried out according to the ethical principles and legal regulations designed in line with human rights and human dignity. There is an urgent need in the interdisciplinary scientific bodies like ethics committees monitoring the research regarding the scientific and ethical values of nonmaleficence, beneficence, autonomy, confidentiality, right to privacy and protection of vulnerable groups. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Ethical issues; Human dignity; Neuromarketing; Neuroscience; Public engagement

However, the brain-as-prediction approach tries to find brain circuits’ activation patterns during persuasive messages, which predict human behaviour in the future situations. The chapter describes the brain valuation circuits, whose activation pattern has been found critical for the prediction of human behaviour in the future. In addition, the most common examples about the brain’s valuation system will be presented from management point of view. Whereas the academic community has produced a lot of research with neuroscientific tools, there is still a lot of room for applications of neuroscience to the innovation and marketing campaign processes. Thus, the chapter describes different stakeholders who can cooperate in order to find optimal products and optimal marketing campaign by using neuromarketing. Because the innovation process includes much uncertainty, it is very critical to encourage all participants to collaborate in the process. The chapter describes the benefits of this collaboration from management point of view. In addition, the concrete examples of how researchers and business innovators together can apply the neuromarketing in order to solve concrete innovation and management problems will be presented.

In this work, we present an innovative study aimed to prove, in a systematic way, that such brain AW index is actually correlated with the “pleasant” or “no-pleasant” perception also of olfactory stimuli, conveniently produced by standardised methods in the sensory specific scientific literature. In particular, we recorded the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal from a group, gender balanced, of 24 healthy and no-smokers subjects during the perception of ten different smells, presented by means of the “Screening test-odour identification” set (Sniffin’ sticks, Burghart). The cerebral AW indexes of all the subjects, for each odorous stimulus, were compared with the appreciation numeric score assessed by the subject during the experiment, by performing a statistical correlation test. Findings show that it is possible to evaluate the pleasantness or no-pleasantness of odorous substances by means of the analysis of EEG signals collected during the presentation of such substances, making way for new applications of such measure kind in experimental environments more and more ecological, as the typical ones of the marketing research areas. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Alpha asymmetry; Approach–withdrawal; EEG; Emotions; Motivations; Neuromarketing; PFC; Pleasantness

First, it might seem strange that marketers would be interested in using neuroscience to understand consumer's preferences. Yet in practice, the basic goal of marketers is to guide the design and presentation of products in such a way that they are highly compatible with consumer preferences. To understand consumers preferences, several standard research tools are commonly used by marketers, such as personal interviews with the consumers, scoring questionnaries gathered from consumers, and focus groups. The reason marketing researchers are interested in using brain imaging tools instead of simply asking people for their preferences in front of marketing stimuli, arises from the assumption that people cannot (or do not want to) fully explain their preference when explicitly asked. Researchers in the field hypothesize that neuroimaging tools can access information within the consumer's brain during the generation of a preference or the observation of a commercial advertisement. The question of will this information be useful in further promoting the product is still up for debate in marketing literature. From the marketing researchers point of view, there is a hope that this body of brain imaging techniques will provide an efficient tradeoff between costs and benefits of the research. © 2012 IEEE.",

The recognition of facial expressions is not an easy problem for machine learning methods, since people can vary significantly in the way they show their expressions. Even images of the same person in the same facial expression can vary in brightness, background and pose, and these variations are emphasized if considering different subjects (because of variations in shape, ethnicity among others). Although facial expression recognition is very studied in the literature, few works perform fair evaluation avoiding mixing subjects while training and testing the proposed algorithms. Hence, facial expression recognition is still a challenging problem in computer vision. In this work, we propose a simple solution for facial expression recognition that uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Network and specific image pre-processing steps. Convolutional Neural Networks achieve better accuracy with big data. However, there are no publicly available datasets with sufficient data for facial expression recognition with deep architectures. Therefore, to tackle the problem, we apply some pre-processing techniques to extract only expression specific features from a face image and explore the presentation order of the samples during training. The experiments employed to evaluate our technique were carried out using three largely used public databases (CK+, JAFFE and BU-3DFE). A study of the impact of each image pre-processing operation in the accuracy rate is presented. The proposed method: achieves competitive results when compared with other facial expression recognition methods – 96.76% of accuracy in the CK+ database – it is fast to train, and it allows for real time facial expression recognition with standard computers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Computer vision; Convolutional Neural Networks; Expression specific features; Facial expression recognition; Machine learning

Thanks to brain imaging, one can better understand what determines this behaviour, and the opinions and preferences of consumers (Lindstrom in Buyology: verdades y mentiras de por qué compramos. Gestión, Barcelona, 2010). However, according to Zaltman (Cómo piensan los consumidores: lo que nuestros clientes no pueden decirnos y nuestros competidores no saben. Empresa Activa, Madrid, 2003), the ethical and moral implications underlying this activity require a judicious and socially responsible use of the information obtained. The method used is based on semi-structured interviews with seven Spanish neuromarketing firms. Thus, in order to respond to the current situation and to predict the future scenario in the short term, they were asked about the knowledge of both the population and Spanish firms, about the situation of the discipline versus traditional market research, and about the lack of specific regulations, among other things. The results demonstrate the incipient state of the discipline, although extensive growth is expected in the coming years.

In so doing, we put the field in an historical context and overview some recent reviews and thought pieces that have touched upon various topics in this emerging discipline. Key arguments for our case include the fact that research methods and paradigms in the organizational sciences could benefit from a consideration of neuroscience issues, and technology has advanced to the point where an infusion of neuroscience methods into organizational research is now highly feasible. In addition, practitioners and practice-oriented media are ready for new approaches and techniques that could utilize neuroscience-based knowledge. Indeed, “C-suite” executives have been willing subjects in many of the studies described in this book and have shown a genuine interest in applying brain-based theories to their own success and to the success of the organizations that they lead. As such, a goal of this book is to begin to connect such emerging knowledge with practice in areas like organizational, employee, and leader development. At the same time, all of the chapters go to great lengths to not get ahead of ourselves in terms of ideas for practice that are not firmly grounded in research. We further place the area of organizational neuroscience in the greater context of related fields, including neuroeconomics and neuromarketing, and we stress the interdisciplinary nature of all of these emerging disciplines. Finally, we overview the remaining chapters and describe how we delineate two parts of the book based on general issues and topical applications, respectively. © 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Management; Neuroscience; Organizations

The paper examines whether or not Machine Learning can tell whether or not a participant likes a short YouTube video using only EEG data. The research is in the preliminary stage (two subjects thus far), but early results are promising. Also discussed in the paper is information regarding commercialization of the invention which is of interest to many universities. A provisional patent application was filed and a critique was gathered from executives from a famous advertising agency regarding commercialization of the invention for Neuromarketing. These executives provided valuable detailed feedback regarding pros and cons of different commercialization possibilities.

Typically, conventional EEG features such as spectral power, coherence, and frontal asymmetry have been used to characterize affective states. Recently, cross-frequency coupling measures have also been explored. In this paper, we propose a new feature set that combines some of these aforementioned paradigms. First, the full-band EEG signal is decomposed into four subband signals, namely theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. The amplitude modulation (or envelope) of these signals is then computed via a Hilbert transform. These amplitude modulations are further decomposed into 10 cross-frequency coupling patterns (e.g., gamma-beta coupling pattern). The mutual information between each of these ten patterns is then calculated for all inter-hemispheric EEG electrode pairs. To gauge the effectiveness of the newly-proposed feature set, the so-called DEAP database was used. Experimental results show the proposed feature set outperforming conventional ones for estimation of arousal, valence, dominance, and liking affective dimensions. Gains of up to 20% could be achieved when the proposed features were fused with spectral power and asymmetry index features, thus suggesting complementarity between spectral and spectro-temporal features for automated affective state recognition. © 2015 IEEE.",

Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the neuroimaging modality widely used in neuromarketing studies, this technology requires large equipment and is relatively expensive, thus hindering its use in practical neuromarketing applications. In contrast, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has many advantages over fMRI, including portable equipment, cost-effectiveness and resistance to artefacts. However, the feasibility of fNIRS-based neuromarketing has not yet been verified because this technique has been rarely used in neuromarketing studies. In the present study, participants were asked to decide which products (various kinds of foods) they preferred while changes in their oxy-haemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) concentrations were recorded using a 16-channel NIR spectroscopy system that coveredthe prefrontal cortex. Our analysis results showed significantly increased Oxy-Hb concentration in the right prefrontal area when less-preferred food images were presented compared to when preferred food images were presented. These preliminary experiments demonstrate that hemodynamic response change in the prefrontal cortex is a potential indicator of the subjective preference of a group of individuals, suggesting that fNIRS can be a promising neuroimaging tool for future neuromarketing studies. © IM Publications LLP 2016.",Decision making; Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS); Neuroeconomics; Neuromarketing; Prefrontal cortex

As a result, applications such as neurofeedback training, neuromarketing, emotion, stress, mental workload recognition, etc. using EEG techniques on healthy adults have been developed. Since the EEG measures and records electrical activity in the brain, it is possible for it to reflect a person’s brain states. In this paper, we describe a novel brain computer interface called CogniMeter integrated with proposed realtime emotion, mental workload, and stress recognition algorithms. With this system, we can assess human emotions, mental workload, and stress in real time. This work can be applied as a human study tool in many fields. For example, the wellbeing of users within a system or workers in industry can be monitored to improve their protection from overly stressful workload conditions. In research, brain state monitoring can be applied in simulation scenarios during human factor study experiments.

A total of 34 right-handed college students participated in the electroencephalography experiment. Measurements were obtained by recording the electrical activity of the left and right frontal areas of the brain while subjects were viewing apparel products.

Realizing that marketing has always been affected by the broader environment, this article looks at worldwide developments over the next 100 years and predicts how these will affect the marketing scheme. Findings suggest that marketing in the future is not just confined to business, advertising, promotion, customer relations, etc., and that marketing is much more important that simply being a tool, but rather an ideology or applied philosophy to the society, business, economy, and life. This paradigm includes convenience marketing, social relationship marketing, marketing as a way to create structured thinking, and marketing as an inherent part of human culture. It seems as if marketing can be anything, and it is omnipresent where people are present, like a sixth dimension. Marketing is a force that has a light and a dark side. In the future, marketing will be a necessary skill for everyone.

The congruence measures the relationship fit between sponsor–sponsee as perceived by the consumer. Previous studies have linked the ability of neuroimaging to predict the acceptance of advertisements (Vecchiato Kong and Wei 2012). The objective of the research is to measure the effect of congruence on the effectiveness of sponsorship and processing information from a neuroscientific point of view. To measure the variable of attention, the electroencephalogram (EEG) system evaluates the change in the signal of the human brain. In such cases, the effectiveness of various marketing strategies may be evaluated by monitoring brain activity. Neurosky, Inc., develops the device used in this research and comparisons of these instruments by medical professionals have found significant similarity in results (Ekandem et al. 2012). The development of the control variables in the experiment was developed through focus groups and surveys, where four sponsorship messages were created. Consumers were utilized in order to obtain results in the degree of attention, time, and processing method of advertising. Statistical tests confirm a significant difference between levels of attention in messages. The two models, consistent and inconsistent messages indicated that only two had similar results accuracy and attention whereas processing time was significantly higher in inconsistent messages. The degree of attention is showed that it was incremental and less successful to individuals who are exposed to inconsistent message and could produce an emotional rejection of sponsorship. Thus in turn, would then suggest then that a higher level of attention combined with higher negative rejection implies the need for more effective communication campaigns (Tribou 2011). The perception of the viewer in a meaningful incongruence scenario can lead to a rejection of the brand in which the viewer would not assimilate the sponsorship (Lindstrom 2008) which would infer in an opposite result from which it was intended. The importance of the research indicates that it is imperative for companies to know the perception of their messages enabling them to develop more efficient messages, not to mention, the amount of sponsors which are associated to events and sports teams due to the transmission of image and attitude towards brand attributes of the brand sponsored and the sponsoring brand (Gwinner 1997).

The sub-discipline of consumer neuroscience that has resulted from that interest belongs to the innovative approach of neuroeconomics. Consumer neuroscience investigates problems of consumption and marketing through methods and findings from neuroscience. Conventional research in consumer behavior and marketing necessarily looked at the human organism as being a ""black box"" which cannot be assessed directly, or physiologically. This was a time when research mainly used theoretical constructs to interpret these bodily processes and resulting behavior. More recently, however, modern techniques and methods in neuroscience have facilitated a far more direct look into the ""black box"" of the organism as the basis for the sub-discipline of consumer neuroscience. Consumer neuroscience, therefore, can significantly benefit research in the field of consumer behavior, particularly in the attempt to better understand human behavior in decision-making processes. Although consumer neuroscience is a fledgling discipline, it constitutes a complementing advancement toward more comprehensive testing and expansion of theory. Against this background, the primary goal of the paper is to provide an overview of methods, findings, and implications of selected studies in consumer neuroscience. Furthermore, we integrate aspects of consumer policy and neuroethics, discussing the possible implications of these insights for consumer protection. © 2010 Springer Basel AG.",Consumer neuroscience; Consumer policy; Neuroethics; Neuromarketing

In this context a so called passive BCI, a system that derives its outputs from arbitrary brain activity for enriching a human-machine interaction with implicit information on the actual user state will be used. Concretely EEG-based BCI technology enables the use of signals related to attention, intentions and mental state, without relying on indirect measures based on overt behavior or other physiological signals which is an important point e.g. in Neuromarketing research. The scope of this pilot EEG-study was to detect like/dislike decisions on car stimuli just by means of ERP analysis. Concretely to define user preferences concerning different car designs by implementing an offline BCI based on shrinkage LDA classification. Although classification failed in the majority of participants the elicited early (sub) conscious ERP components reflect user preferences for cars. In a broader sense this study should pave the way towards a 'product design BCI' suitable for neuromarketing research. © 2015 IEEE.",

Numerous studies have indicated that in reality, people do not necessarily recognize the influences on their own preferences and misrecognize the rationale for their preferences. Neuromarketing, which is the application of neuroscientific findings to marketing has been gaining attention as a method of exploring concealed consumer needs. This chapter summarizes research that is representative of neuromarketing (McClure et al. 2004), and then introduces the author’s studies exploring the application of findings on the cognitive background of individual differences in behaviors when purchasing unknown products. Furthermore, the chapter discusses the possibilities of neuromarketing as a method of exploring hidden consumer needs and preferences. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",

Neuroscience is increasingly applied to the investigation of the neurophysiological bases of the perception of and reaction to commercial stimuli to support traditional marketing methods. In this context, a particular sector or marketing is represented by public service announcements (PSAs). The objective of this protocol is to apply electroencephalography (EEG) and autonomic signal analysis to study responses to selected antismoking PSAs. Two EEG indices were employed: the frontal alpha band EEG asymmetry (the Approach Withdrawal (AW) index) and the frontal theta (effort index). Furthermore, the autonomic Emotional Index (EI) was calculated, as derived from the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Heart Rate (HR) signals. The present protocol describes a series of operational and computational steps required to properly estimate, through the aforementioned indices, the emotional and cerebral reaction of a group of subjects towards a selected number of antismoking PSAs. In particular, a campaign characterized by a symbolic communication style (classified as ""awarded"" on the basis of the prizes received by specialized committees) obtained the highest approach values, as estimated by the AW index. A spot and an image belonging to the same PSA campaign based on the ""fear arousing appeal"" and with a narrative/experiential communication style (classified as ""effective"" on the basis of the economical/health-related improvements promoted) reported the lowest and highest effort values, respectively. This is probably due to the complexity of the storytelling (spot) and to the immediateness of the image (a lady who underwent a tracheotomy). Finally, the same ""effective"" campaign showed the highest EI values, possibly because of the empathy induced by the testimonial and the explicitness of the message. © 2017 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.",Alpha; Alpha asymmetry; Approach withdrawal theory; Consumer neuroscience; Electroencephalography; Emotion; Emotional index; Galvanic skin response; Heart rate; Issue 126; Neuromarketing; Neuroscience; Theta

For maintaining such requirements, there is a need to monitor visual attention for a defense personnel. Eye movements, captured through eye tracker can reveal visual engagements with the help of examining the direction of eye gaze. This not only reveals the opinion and behavioral patterns but also gives an idea that the brain can reveal hidden and profitable truths about consumers. Henceforth making it applicable in defense as well as in neuromarketing, as both domain want to grab visual attention of their personnel. This study tries to assess visual engagements through eye tracker using neuromarketing paradigm. Results can further be extended to the defense areas both fields involve visual attention. This paper investigates the use of Eyetracking as a potential research tool for analyzing the features that drives attention towards certain target (advertisement in this case). It is believed that eye movements are best indicators of visual attention. This paper gives an insight on the features that help us analyze visual attention and retention as tools to distinguish the effectiveness of the advertisement. The best feature of eye movements captured from eye tracking can identify glimpse of visual attention. Thus, making it greatly important in the use of defence as visual attention and henceforth brain reflexes are effected at immediate situations making it useful for surveillance, required feature in situational awareness and surveillance for border. This work here is of potential use in defence as it gives the measures of opinion and behavior of brain patterns of subjects revealing their hidden and profitable truths as that of customers. © 2016 IEEE.",advertising; attention; Eye tracking; Neuromarketing; retention

Neurotourism mainly explores the neural mechanism underlying tourists’ behaviors and aims to advance tourism research. Neuroscience tools can obtain objective neurophysiology data from human body, serving as potential measurements of some constructs such as happiness, tourism satisfaction and revisiting intention. Besides, neuroscience tools can also capture and record the cognitive and emotional process in real-time during tourism experience and this application helps the tourism manager achieve better monitoring and scheduling. Thus we suggest that neurophysiology data should be added to management information system.

It promises to offer a privileged access to the most intimate emotions and unconscious thoughts, which should serve as an undisputed background for effective marketing practices. It promises to be successful where traditional market research techniques and tools failed. But this does not come cheap: a lot of public figures, philosophers and neuroscientists expressed multiple concerns regarding the ethical and legal implications of the neuromarketing research and applications. The aim of this study is to map these ethical concerns and provide a series of elements which can help both researchers and practitioners clarify the ethical limits of their work. The chapter contains two major sections and some brief closing remarks. The first one contains two major distinctions which will serve as basis for the entire ethical discussion in the next section: neuromarketing as both a field of research and applications and neuromarketing ethics as research ethics and as ethics of brain research. The second section is dedicated to a quasi-comprehensive presentation of the ethical challenges of neuromarketing. These topoi are divided in three categories: ethics of neuromarketing research (overclaiming; research conduct-informed consent, protection of vulnerable research participants, paying participants; data practices-research design and scientific validity, confidentiality, research dual use; publication practices-authorship, cherry-picking and salami-slicing, research transparency); ethics of neuromarketing technologies (no harm; privacy; incidental findings); and ethics of neuromarketing applications (manipulative and deceptive marketing practices; exacerbating the emotional factor). © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Brain imagining; Consent; Human dignity; Neuromarketing ethics; Research ethics

This field of research is known as neuromarketing. In this article, we illustrate some applications of electrical neuroimaging, a discipline that uses electroencephalography (EEG) and intensive signal processing techniques for the evaluation of marketing stimuli. We also show how the proper usage of these methodologies can provide information related to memorization and attention while people are watching marketing-relevant stimuli. We note that temporal and frequency patterns of EEG signals are able to provide possible descriptors that convey information about the cognitive process in subjects observing commercial advertisements (ads). Such information could be unobtainable through common tools used in standard marketing research. Evidence of this research shows how EEG methodologies could be employed to better design new products that marketers are going to promote and to analyze the global impact of video commercials already broadcast on TV. © 2012 IEEE.",
