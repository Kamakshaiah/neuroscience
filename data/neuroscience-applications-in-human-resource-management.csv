Design/methodology/approach – The research questions guiding the study is in what ways can the recent findings in cognitive neuroscience help to inform adult education theory, including andragogy in particular, to deepen our understanding of how andragogical instructional principles and practices can improve learning? We adopted Torraco’s (2005) integrative literature review approach of providing enough details regarding the selection of the literature and the identification and verification of emerged themes of main ideas. Findings – The core assumptions of andragogy (self-direction, prior experience, readiness to learn and immediacy of application) have a connection to the neural networks related to memory and cognition. Research limitations/implications – First, this study provides fundamental foundations for combining cognitive neuroscience and adult learning to illuminate how cognitive neuroscience contributes physiologically to adult learning. Second, the findings in cognitive neuroscience related to the four assumptions for andragogy help to provide scientific explanations and interpretations for adult learning theories influencing human resource development (HRD), such as self-directed learning, experiential learning and role theory. Practical implications – First, HRD practitioners could use the integrative approach between andragogy and the cognitive neuroscience to reduce the issues of learning activities in generation differences. In addition, cognitive neuroscience research may contribute to improving teaching and instructional techniques. Originality/value – The contributions of this study is that it provides an integrative review about why and how anagogical principles work through the lens of cognitive neuroscience. Based on the findings, we suggested a model of adaptive cognitive neuroscience-adult learning structures. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Adult learning and education; Andragogy; Cognitive neuroscience; Management education; Readiness to learn and immediacy of application; Self-directed learning and prior experience"

Detailed observation highlights that not one day passes without the mass media referring to neuroscience as the solution to a variety of problems arising from non-clinical disciplines. A broad research approach into the many disciplines defined and prefixed by ""neuro"" is necessary in order to provide an in-depth understanding of the concepts that underlie such transformational disciplines as Nneuro-strategy, Neuro-leadership, Neuro-marketing, Neuro-economics, and Neuro-education. Purpose: The current study aims at determining a neuro-scientific strategy for conceptualizing healthier work outcomes based on human resource management. Methodology: This study is a qualitative study that uses secondary data from the literature and provides a descriptive analysis of the neuro-scientific approaches toward human resource management in order to predict better workplace outcomes. The method for completing the data search on the database used neuro-scientific predictions about, workers, work outcomes, neuroscientific management, and human resource management. Results and implications: The study demonstrates and intellectualises that neuro-scientific approaches would provide insights into human resource management which would bring about healthier work outcomes. The study results support the benefit of creating a structured method derived from classical methods of neuroscience in order to investigate a transformational neuroscientific approach and to better understand human responses and strengths through a neuroscientific approach. Conclusion: The study brings new insights to Human Resource Management at work that enhances the quality of Human Resource Management in the workplace. © RJPT All right reserved.","and human resource management; Neuro-scientific predictions about; neuroscientific management; work outcomes; workers"

Specifically, it provides a comprehensive and balanced response to critiques associated with the construct within the contemporary positive psychological literature. These critiques revolve around the lack of consensus in the conceptualisation, measurement, and management of grit, as well as consensus on its difference from other psychological constructs such as conscientiousness, diligence or determination. Therefore, this volume thoroughly reappraises and consolidates the nature, function, measurement and implications of grit in order to effectively advance the science of achievement. It looks at grit scales developed in various countries and evaluates the concept in various aspects of life, from work performance to sports. Written by a team of multi-disciplinary experts in fields ranging from neuroscience, sociology, and education to human resource management and psychology, this volume firmly positions grit within the discipline of positive psychology's nomological lexicon. © All rights reserved.",""

Findings of this study are reported in the form of neuroscience research articles. We propose a tool, ConnExt-BioBERT, to mine relevant scientific literature for curating a large resource of reported connections between regions of the brain. We have utilized the popular transfer learning technique that has been trained on large datasets, the Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers (BERT) to apply it to a narrowband subject area of extracting brain regions and potential connection mentions from a set of 53,000 full-text neuroscience articles (53kNeuroFullText) indexed on PubMed. Evaluation of ConnExt-BioBERT has been performed on a benchmark dataset of abstracts and on a dataset of seven full-text articles annotated by a domain expert. Additionally, connections retrieved by the tool on 53kNeuroFullText have been evaluated using a manually curated resource, Brain Architecture Management System (BAMS). A web-application has been developed for search over extracted brain region connections on 53kNeuroFullText. This application is currently being used by neuroscience researchers to quickly retrieve brain connectivity information reported by various authors. Large scale text mining of brain-connectivity information reported in neuroscience literature, aids in progressing research in the area of neurological disorders and further helps diagnosis and treatment of the same. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Brain region connectivity extraction; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Text mining"

These data sets, however, are typically neither integrated nor interoperable, resulting in a barrier to answering complex neuroscience research questions. Domain ontologies can enable the querying heterogeneous data sets, but they are not sufficient for neuroscience since the data of interest commonly span multiple research domains. To this end, e-Neuroscience seeks to provide an integrated platform for neuroscientists to discover new knowledge through seamless integration of the very diverse types of neuroscience data. Here we present a Semantic Web approach to building this e-Neuroscience framework by using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and its vocabulary description language, RDF Schema (RDFS), as a standard data model to facilitate both representation and integration of the data. Results: We have constructed a pilot ontology for BrainPharm (a subset of SenseLab) using RDFS and then converted a subset of the BrainPharm data into RDF according to the ontological structure. We have also integrated the converted BrainPharm data with existing RDF hypothesis and publication data from a pilot version of SWAN (Semantic Web Applications in Neuromedicine). Our implementation uses the RDF Data Model in Oracle Database 10g release 2 for data integration, query, and inference, while our Web interface allows users to query the data and retrieve the results in a convenient fashion. Conclusion: Accessing and integrating biomedical data which cuts across multiple disciplines will be increasingly indispensable and beneficial to neuroscience researchers. The Semantic Web approach we undertook has demonstrated a promising way to semantically integrate data sets created independently. It also shows how advanced queries and inferences can be performed over the integrated data, which are hard to achieve using traditional data integration approaches. Our pilot results suggest that our Semantic Web approach is suitable for realizing e-Neuroscience and generic enough to be applied in other biomedical fields. © 2007 Lam et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",""

Furthermore, the rate at which the latter arises in certain cases is considerably higher than what people are accustomed to. There are both similarities and differences between human and machine knowledge, which requires an update of the concept of knowledge. The similarity that is particularly relevant for the epoch of digital economy is the decision-making process, which inevitably accompanies knowledge. In all cyclic models describing knowledge production, beginning with the Shewhart-Deming cycle (PDCA), the decision making is presented, in one way or another. At the same time, knowledge management has yet to duly adapt promising neuroscience developments that offer higher accuracy in formalization of processes that determine a human-made decision. In a digital economy, we can observe growing demands on the speed and complexity of the decisions made, as well as substantial increase of the share of decisions made by robots (autonomous algorithms). For example, in large retail networks, a human no longer interferes with the pricing decisions for the goods sold. It is currently unknown which parts of the knowledge acquired by machines are unavailable to a human. A disruption in knowledge exchange between humans and machines can be unnoticeable and would not necessarily cause a loss of knowledge at an organizational level. However, safety control in this case is to provide a guarantee against errors for new machine-made decisions. In knowledge exchange between humans, new additional feedback factors arise that reduce the risk of erroneous decisions. But similar mechanisms are not currently provided for machines. Building upon existing approaches to knowledge exchange - stock and flow approaches, - it is proposed to adopt, for knowledge management purposes, a multi-Agent approach made known, inter alia, through works of M. Wooldridge. One premise for an application of a multi-Agent approach is the definition of knowledge as a network (usually, neural) created to represent the reality and interact with it. Because networks should merge for a more accurate representation of the reality, the carriers of such networks -Agents - create an interaction environment. Application of a multi-Agent approach assumes establishment of rules at several levels. Basic level -An ""attestation"" of an agent for operations in the environment and a resolution of disputes. Level of statuses requires an agent to be in one of the conditional states for knowledge exchange. Also, the rules can define resource limits for exchange and create stimuluses for agents to perform. Finally, indicators and a monitoring system will allow to timely identify problem areas of exchange where resolution is required. © Copyright The Authors, 2018.

PageRank, together with many of its random walk based variants, has become one of the most well-known and widely used algorithms, due to its mathematical elegance and the superior performance across a variety of application domains. Important as it might be, state-of-the-art lacks an intuitive way to explain the ranking results by PageRank (or its variants), e.g., why it thinks the returned top-k webpages are the most important ones in the entire graph; why it gives a higher rank to actor John than actor Smith in terms of their relevance w.r.t. a particular movie?In order to answer these questions, this paper proposes a paradigm shift for PageRank, from identifying which nodes are most important to understanding why the ranking algorithm gives a particular ranking result. We formally define the PageRank auditing problem, whose central idea is to identify a set of key graph elements (e.g., edges, nodes, subgraphs) with the highest influence on the ranking results. We formulate it as an opti-mization problem and propose a family of effective and scalable algorithms (Aurora) to solve it. Our algorithms measure the influence of graph elements and incrementally select influential elements w.r.t. their gradients over the ranking results. We perform extensive empirical evaluations on real-world datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed methods (Aurora) provide intuitive explanations with a linear scalability. © 2018 IEEE.","explainability; Graph mining; PageRank"

A second new feature is an aligned atlas of bilateral flatmaps illustrating rat nervous system development from the neural plate stage to the adult stage, where most gray matter regions, white matter tracts, ganglia, and nerves listed in the nomenclature tables are illustrated schematically. These flatmaps are convenient for future development of online applications analogous to “Google Maps” for systems neuroscience. The third new feature is a completely revised Atlas of the rat brain in spatially aligned transverse sections that can serve as a framework for 3-D modeling. Atlas parcellation is little changed from the preceding edition, but the nomenclature for rat is now aligned with an emerging panmammalian neuroanatomical nomenclature.

Through the development of peripheral neural interfaces and invasive electrodes, an individual's own nervous system can be used to control a prosthesis. With novel improvements in neural recording and signal decoding, this intimate communication has paved the way for bidirectional and intuitive control of prostheses. While various collaborations between engineers and surgeons have led to considerable success with motor control and pain management, it has been significantly more challenging to restore sensation. Many of the existing peripheral neural interfaces have demonstrated success in one of these modalities; however, none are currently able to fully restore limb function. Though this is in part due to the complexity of the human somatosensory system and stability of bioelectronics, the fragmentary and as-yet uncoordinated nature of the neuroprosthetic industry further complicates this advancement. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current field of neuroprosthetics and explore potential strategies to address its unique challenges. These include exploration of electrodes, surgical techniques, control methods, and prosthetic technology. Additionally, we propose a new approach to optimizing prosthetic limb function and facilitating clinical application by capitalizing on available resources. It is incumbent upon academia and industry to encourage collaboration and utilization of different peripheral neural interfaces in combination with each other to create versatile limbs that not only improve function but quality of life. Despite the rapidly evolving technology, if the field continues to work in divided “silos,” we will delay achieving the critical, valuable outcome: creating a prosthetic limb that is right for the patient and positively affects their life. © Copyright © 2021 Karczewski, Dingle and Poore.","amputation; clinical translation; human machine collaboration; neuroprosthetic; neuroprosthetic interfacing; peripheral nerve interface; prosthesis; sensory motor function"

Background: The relevance, meaning and effectiveness of FCC have been challenged recently. Studies show that parents in hospital often feel unsupported, judged by hospital staff and uncertain about what care they should give to their child. With no convincing evidence relating FCC to improved child health outcomes, it has been suggested that FCC should be replaced with a new improved model to guide the care of children in hospital. Design: This integrative review discusses theory and evidence-based literature that supports the practice of an alternative model of FCC that is focused on the health and developmental outcomes of children who are seriously ill, rather than the organisational requirements of children's hospitals. Methods: Theories and research findings in a wide range of disciplines including epidemiology, psychology, sociology, anthropology and neuroscience were accessed for this discussion. Nursing literature regarding partnership building, communication and FCC was also accessed. Discussion: This paper discusses the benefits of applying a bioecological model of human development, the family and community resource framework, the concepts of allostatic load and biological embedding, empowerment theory, and the nurse-family partnership model to FCC. Conclusion: While there is no direct evidence showing that the implementation of this alternative model of FCC in the hospital setting improves the health and developmental outcomes of children who are seriously ill, there is a great deal of evidence from community nursing practice that suggests it is very likely to do so. Relevance to clinical practice: Application of these theoretical concepts to practice has the potential to underpin a theory of nursing that is relevant for all nurses irrespective of the age of those they care for and the settings within which they work. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Bioecological theory; Biological embedding; Family resources and psychosocial influences; Family-centred care; Nurse-family partnership"

It is even more difficult to provide extensible software environments able to effectively target the rapidly changing data requirements and structures of research experiments. There is an increasing request from the neuroscience community for software tools addressing technical challenges about: (i) supporting researchers in the medical field to carry out data analysis using integrated bioinformatics services and tools; (ii) handling multimodal/multiscale data and metadata, enabling the injection of several different data types according to structured schemas; (iii) providing high extensibility, in order to address different requirements deriving from a large variety of applications simply through a user runtime configuration. A dynamically extensible data structure supporting collaborative multidisciplinary research projects in neuroscience has been defined and implemented. We have considered extensibility issues from two different points of view. First, the improvement of data flexibility has been taken into account. This has been done through the development of a methodology for the dynamic creation and use of data types and related metadata, based on the definition of ""meta"" data model. This way, users are not constrainted to a set of predefined data and the model can be easily extensible and applicable to different contexts. Second, users have been enabled to easily customize and extend the experimental procedures in order to track each step of acquisition or analysis. This has been achieved through a process-event data structure, a multipurpose taxonomic schema composed by two generic main objects: events and processes. Then, a repository has been built based on such data model and structure, and deployed on distributed resources thanks to a Grid-based approach. Finally, data integration aspects have been addressed by providing the repository application with an efficient dynamic interface designed to enable the user to both easily query the data depending on defined datatypes and view all the data of every patient in an integrated and simple way. The results of our work have been twofold. First, a dynamically extensible data model has been implemented and tested based on a ""meta"" data-model enabling users to define their own data types independently from the application context. This data model has allowed users to dynamically include additional data types without the need of rebuilding the underlying database. Then a complex process-event data structure has been built, based on this data model, describing patient-centered diagnostic processes and merging information from data and metadata. Second, a repository implementing such a data structure has been deployed on a distributed Data Grid in order to provide scalability both in terms of data input and data storage and to exploit distributed data and computational approaches in order to share resources more efficiently. Moreover, data managing has been made possible through a friendly web interface. The driving principle of not being forced to preconfigured data types has been satisfied. It is up to users to dynamically configure the data model for the given experiment or data acquisition program, thus making it potentially suitable for customized applications. Based on such repository, data managing has been made possible through a friendly web interface. The driving principle of not being forced to preconfigured data types has been satisfied.

Clarifying the more precise role of emotions and their regulation in forming a judgment in different managerial decision-making contexts, exploring how team members function synchronously, and the links between psychophysiological traits and how they relate to leadership, have been recurring subjects of interest. In this document, we present the psychophysiological response of eight senior project managers and eight junior project managers as they are faced with a challenging situation designed to assess some of the most relevant personal skills in project management: teamwork, management, problem, and conflicts resolution. Noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG), voice recording (VoR) and video recording (ViR) were performed during the application of an Assessment Center evaluation in addition to before and after heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and pulse oximetry (SpO2) measurements. The results suggest that the voice frequency is related to the task that a subject performs. In this case, an activity that requires active discussion causes a person to talk at a higher pitch, which is the mean value of the fundamental frequency of the voice. In relation to the analysis of the voice depending on the project management expertise, no significant differences were found for calculated voice features. These results suggest that the voice features are not related with the project management expertise. On the other hand, the coefficient of variation of facial redness for junior project managers groups was higher than those of the senior manager groups. This indicates that even though facial readiness was not universally higher for the junior project manager, it is much more prevalent in those with the shorter project management expertise. With respect to the estimation of subject's task engagement, measured through head movement cue analysis, it can be said that this method of engagement estimation proved to be in accordance with the expert psychology's opinion. In concern with EEG, no statistically significant differences were found in frontal asymmetry value between the discussion stage and the presentation and ideation stage and between Senior and Junior managers in the discussion stage. Regarding the before and after heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and pulse oximetry (SpO2) measurements, even though, in general all three variables had a discernible behavior (HR and BP increased while SpO2 decreased), no statistical relevant differences were found in the pre and pose measurements. However, it can be said that the Assessment Center evaluation induced a physiological response on the subjects since, at least one of three variables varied for each subject. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The authors discuss load modeling, renewable distributed generation insertion, local control strategies and a general load flow method designed for balanced and unbalanced microgrids capable of operating connected to the main grid. Two types of primary control are discussed in this book: conventional power control for a residential fuel cell, and virtual synchronous generator control for a battery. The proposed method enables surplus/shortage power in a transient microgrid to be effectively and autonomously interchanged among clusters without using any tertiary control. Later, the authors aim to devise a solution for optimal dispatch of the energy resources in a microgrid being used to continue supplying critical loads during power outages. The goal is to maximize the number of loads served subject to the operational and technical constrains of the microgrid. This compilation includes a novel optimal fractional order general type-2 fuzzy logic proportional-integral-derivative (FOGT2FPID) controller book for the load frequency control of Shipboard MGs. Later, the Load Frequency Control Model is considered for its propensity to stabilize the frequency of the system in the presence of Distributed Generation, two Electric Vehicles as energy storage, and intermittent load and wind power profiles as uncertainties. The authors analyze the details of Neuroscience Based Control approaches, human brain emotional learning and Hebb learning controllers. Next, a critical review of fundamental knowledge and theories underpinning the formation of Microgrids, as well as techniques and strategies that have been proposed in recent years for the purpose of maintaining their stability, are provided.

PageRank, along with many of its variants, is widely used across these application domains thanks to its mathematical elegance and the superior performance. Although PageRank and its variants are effective in ranking nodes on graphs, they often lack an efficient and effective way to audit the ranking results in terms of the input graph structure, e.g., which node or edge in the graph contributes most to the top-1 ranked node; which subgraph plays a crucial role in generating the overall ranking result? In this paper, we propose to audit graph ranking by finding the influential graph elements (e.g., edges, nodes, attributes, and subgraphs) regarding their impact on the ranking results. First, we formulate graph ranking auditing problem as quantifying the influence of graph elements on the ranking results. Second, we show that our formulation can be applied to a variety of graph structures. Third, we propose effective and efficient algorithms to find the top-kk influential edges/nodes/subgraph.

Aging plays a decisive role in cognitive impairment and in the architectural transformations that occur in the brain. Furthermore, the management of demented patients involves numerous economic and human resources, and it is a hot topic of the field of the research. In 1998, Patrick “Pat” O’Reilly Brown developed microarray technology for genome-wide analysis. This method is based on the uses of microchips containing anchored arrays of 1000 short DNA probes for the large-scale interrogation of gene expression. In recent years, this technology has found several applications and functions; in particular, it was used in the field of medicine and related areas. One of the areas of application is represented by neuroscience. However, the microarray study based on brain biopsies presents different technical problems such as the postmortem interval time on brain tissue preservation, the complete collection of clinical data, and the correct choice of available array platforms.

Rather than implementing these tasks from scratch, scientists benefit greatly from using reusable software routines from freely available toolboxes. Existing toolboxes work well when the operating system and hardware are painstakingly optimized, but may be less suited to applications that require multi-tasking (for example, closed-loop systems that involve real-time acquisition and processing of signals). New method: We introduce a new cross-platform visual stimulus toolbox called Shady (https://pypi.org/project/Shady)—so called because of its heavy reliance on a shader program to perform parallel pixel processing on a computer's graphics processor. It was designed with an emphasis on performance robustness in multi-tasking applications under unforgiving conditions. For optimal timing performance, the CPU drawing management commands are carried out by a compiled binary engine. For configuring stimuli and controlling their changes over time, Shady provides a programmer's interface in Python, a powerful, accessible and widely-used high-level programming language. Results: Our timing benchmark results illustrate that Shady's hybrid compiled/interpreted architecture requires less time to complete drawing operations, exhibits smaller variability in frame-to-frame timing, and hence drops fewer frames, than pure-Python solutions under matched conditions of resource contention. This performance gain comes despite an expansion of functionality (e.g. “noisy-bit” dithering as standard on all pixels and all frames, to enhance effective dynamic range) relative to previous offerings. Conclusions: Shady simultaneously advances the functionality and performance available to scientists for rendering visual stimuli and manipulating them in real time. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",""

Neuroimaging rapid evolution is demanding for a growing number of computing resources and skills that need to be put in place at every lab. Typically each group tries to setup their own servers and workstations to support their neuroimaging needs, having to learn from Operating System management to specific neuroscience software tools details before any results can be obtained from each setup. This setup and learning process is replicated in every lab, even if a strong collaboration among several groups is going on. In this paper we present a new cloud service model - Brain Imaging Application as a Service (BiAaaS) - and one of its implementation - Advanced Brain Imaging Lab (ABrIL) - in the form of an ubiquitous virtual desktop remote infrastructure that offers a set of neuroimaging computational services in an interactive neuroscientist-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). This remote desktop has been used for several multi-institution cooperative projects with different neuroscience objectives that already achieved important results, such as the contribution to a high impact paper published in the January issue of the Neuroimage journal. The ABrIL system has shown its applicability in several neuroscience projects with a relatively low-cost, promoting truly collaborative actions and speeding up project results and their clinical applicability. © 2014 IEEE.",""

Resolving this requires strategies that synergize salient local resources with tailored foreign help. This study is a trial of a twinning model adopted by the Swedish African Neurosurgical Collaboration (SANC). Methods: A multi-step neurosurgical twinning technique, International Neurosurgical Twinning Modeled for Africa (INTIMA), developed through a collaboration between African and Swedish neurosurgical teams was adopted for a neurosurgical mission in March 2019. The pioneering steps are evaluated together with data of treated patients prospectively acquired using SPSS Chicago Inc., Version 23. Associations were analyzed using chi-square tests, while inferences were evaluated at 95% level of significance. Results: The SANC global neurosurgery mission targeted microsurgical brain tumor resection. Fifty-five patients were operated on during the mission and subsequent 3 months. Patients’ ages ranged from 3 months to 69 years with a mean of 30.6 ± 2.1 years 95% CL. Seven cases were performed during the first mission, while 48 were performed after the mission. Compared to 3 months before SANC when only 9 brain tumors were resected, more tumors were resected (n = 25) within the 3 consecutive months from the mission (X2 = 14.2, DF = 1, P = 0.000). Thirty-day mortality following tumor resection was also lower, X2 = 4.8, DF = 1, P = 0.028.

Often in academic research studies the goals for informatics teams are to build applications that provide extract-transform-load (ETL) functionality to archive and catalog source data that has been collected by the research teams. In consortia that cross species and methodological or scientific domains, building interfaces which supply data in a usable fashion and make intuitive sense to scientists from dramatically different backgrounds increases the complexity for developers. Further, reusing source data from outside one’s scientific domain is fraught with ambiguities in understanding the data types, analysis methodologies, and how to combine the data with those from other research teams. We report on the design, implementation, and performance of a semantic data management application to support the NIMH funded Conte Center at the University of California, Irvine. The Center is testing a theory of the consequences of “fragmented” (unpredictable, high entropy) early-life experiences on adolescent cognitive and emotional outcomes in both humans and rodents. It employs cross-species neuroimaging, epigenomic, molecular, and neuroanatomical approaches in humans and rodents to assess the potential consequences of fragmented unpredictable experience on brain structure and circuitry. To address this multi-technology, multi-species approach, the system uses semantic web techniques based on the Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM) to facilitate data ETL functionality. We find this approach enables a low-cost, easy to maintain, and semantically meaningful information management system, enabling the diverse research teams to access and use the data. © 2017 The Author(s).","Database; MRI; Neuroscience; NIDM; RDF; Semantic web"

The requests for services of psychologists in many various domains have also increased in an unprecedented way over a number of years. In spite of this development, which should continue to increase considerably, the initial training of psychologists remains uneven and disparate and often remote from, even unsuitable to, the legitimate expectations of users. It is therefore important to reform this training by extending, updating, homogenising and adapting it to current knowledge and needs, and by marking it by a single and specific degree: that of a doctorate. This new eight-year doctoral curriculum would be at the same time more complete and simpler than the European Diploma in Psychology model (EuroPsy), for instance. This latter is a very complicated and insufficient subject and would not completely resolve the great problems of psychologists' training and the competences they need to gain in order to access professional practise, research and teaching. This extension of the psychologists' training would make it possible to integrate new data concerning traditional fields of psychology and data concerning new fields of application of psychology and should obviously include the essential training for psychotherapies referred to the great theoretical and practical models, since their interest is clinically acknowledged (psychoanalysis and psychoanalytical therapies, cognitive and behavioural therapies, systemic therapies, therapies for individuals, couples, families, groups...). This polyreferred training would make it possible to go from a culture still too often axed on orientation and deficiencies of the therapist, to a culture of indication, opening and competence, focused on the patient's interest. Teaching of psychophysiology and neurosciences should be updated and harmonised by taking into account the great current and future stakes of public health. It should be supplemented by psychopharmacology lectures. This reform of psychologists' training would ensure a common pedestal of increased knowledge coupled with theoretical/practical competence. The positive consequences of such a reform would relate to many fields. Here are six examples. Tracks of work: Education: prevention, tracking, treatment of personal problems or of instruction from nursery school to university; orientation; council, assistance with managing difficulties of teaching staff, etc. Health: tracking, prevention, diagnosis, treatment of psychic and behavioural disorders, of addictive attitudes, of psychological problems related to somatic pathologies (cancer, HIV, etc.), of problems related to ageing of population; training and supervision of medical staff, etc. Justice: caring of victims, of offenders in prison or out of prison, fight against repetition, expertise, staff training (magistrates, lawyers, penitentiary staff, social workers...). Work context: (companies, public and private organisations): recruitment, management of staff problems, human resources management, coaching, competence assessment, orientation, etc. Sport: assessment, management and improvement of performances, management of stress, success, failures, and career; fight against doping; help for retraining after suspension of activity, etc. Research: development of many useful research axes in relation to ground needs in all application fields of psychology. Such a reform, which would make it possible to shift towards a training more adapted to reality, more homogeneous and aiming at excellence, would ensure better guarantees of service to psychologist users and to their possible employers. Beyond a deep improvement of their initial training and their offer of competence, it would also enable psychologists to witness a very clear improvement of their professional status as well as their level of remuneration. The number of trained psychologists could be adapted to the needs of our society by organizing a numerus clausus for access in a Master 1. This regulation would leave at least three years to students to show their motivations and competence. It would also give a valuable licence level (clearly recognized on the European scene) to students who do not continue the university course in psychology and want to reorientate themselves (entrance exams, studies or professions requiring good prerequisite in social studies and nature studies, etc.). Some suggestions: Those already authorised to hold the title of psychologist when this doctorate is created would not be obliged to validate it, but would profit from the progress generated by this important improvement in the initial training (status, remuneration, etc). If some of these people wished to validate it, they could do so within a defined time and according to defined methods (additional training, validation of experience assets, thesis, etc.). To help students to materially take up the extension of the curriculum, systems of financial assistance for the last three years of studies should be set up either in the form of study allowances, or in the form of internship with remunerated professional implication in the great sectors of exercise of psychology (education, legal and paralegal sectors, industry and work sectors, health, etc.) in parallel and in addition to university training. Internship should be privileged because it would permit the achievement of four objectives: immersion of very advanced students in professional exercise while maintaining training them under supervision, to offer them various and crucial grounds of exercise and research that are adapted to reality, to remunerate them and hence also, offer an important professional service to users (individuals or institutions). The most important and essential improvement added to the initial training of psychologists by the creation of this new doctoral course would not exclude continuous training when necessary in career course. This reform aiming at excellence, which is socially and humanly highly necessary, must obviously also be accompanied by an indispensable and important revision of the criteria in the selection and competence of those who will dispense this renewed training (the current criteria used to recruit psychology teachers have been widely contested and deemed to be, justly so, the main cause of shortcomings of the initial training of psychologists and of their professional segmentation). An aggregative or postdoctoral route should thus be created to recruit future psychology teachers in the higher education (public and private). This recruitment should take into account candidates' theoretical knowledge, but also their knowledge of the profession and their qualities in its exercise. Thus the following criteria are essential when recruiting psychology teachers: validation of the reformed doctorate in psychology (and possibly validation of trainings complementing this doctorate); practice in the field of the psychologist's job (during at least 10 years full-time, followed by the possibility of becoming practitioner-teacher-researcher in psychology, in the sector of experiments and acquired competences, if the candidate is selected at aggregation); ability to teach and capacity to train the future psychologists for the professional acts they will be susceptible to conduct; capacity to conceive, initiate, carry out, direct and communicate useful research. Recruiting all psychology teachers in the stock of professional psychologists who are experienced, talented, skilled and who perform in all the application fields of the discipline as practitioner-teacher-researcher, is vital to implement these essential improvements in psychologists' training, exercise and research. It is therefore a priority for the future of French and European psychologists to set up as fast as possible a reformed doctorate and an aggregation (or, with regard to the aggregation, an equivalent formalised cursus); it is the common interest of psychology professionals, of their trainers and even more so of their users (people or institutions). This reform, based on the excellence of training and services offered, would also make it possible to preserve the essential unity of discipline and profession beyond the multiplicity of their sectors of application and intervention. It would also facilitate possibilities for insertion, for change of sector in career course and for professional geographical mobility. It would finally clarify the ""psy"" nebula for users, which is very important and necessary. Conclusion: It is more than ever essential to develop and update in excellence the high level ""psy"" generalist profession, the profession of psychologist, which users need in many fields of their private, professional or social life. We should guarantee that European Union countries, eager for development and modernity, will rapidly be able to initiate this type of good sense reform, which, by improving care for people and collective balance, would be a new and important step in their humanistic traditions (according to the World Health Organization, one person out of four is in psychological distress). Since psychism and human behaviour are complex and central in all fields of life, the existence of highly qualified psychologists to help them is imperative. Reaching this high level of updated qualification is technically possible and humanly impossible to avoid. Fast reforms must make this requirement achievable. It is in the interest of all the European Union, and all its member states must become a reference and an example in the world for teaching and professional practise of what has become a key discipline: psychology. © 2008.","Doctorate; Europe; European diploma in psychology; EuroPsy; Health; Psychologist; Psychology; Psychotherapist; Psychotherapy; Training"

Different countries and regions are at various stages of this journey, and will take a unique path, depending on their specific social and cultural dynamics. However, all participants are unified by an increasing awareness of, and concern for, animal welfare. This journey has been characterised by a number of landmark events, one of which was the release of the Five Freedoms concept. Although aspirational and abstract, as it did not outline specific practical goals, nonetheless this concept became a catalyst for moving animal welfare thinking in a new direction, and set up a number of important targets for research. This eventually led to a key shift in thinking from a focus on biological functioning and resources, to ways of assessing welfare outcomes in terms of animals' experiences, i.e. their affective states. Behaviour science played an important role in the interpretation of animals' affective experiences, receiving compelling support from parallel studies in affective neuroscience. An important aspect of our understanding of animal welfare is that affective states can be negative or positive. Enabling animals to perform specific behaviours at key times when they are needed is central to the achievement of positive affective states. Another important event has been the development of practical ways to shift the spectrum of affective states towards a positive balance and their incorporation into welfare codes and regulations. The recent focus on positive affective states does not mean that negative experiences should be given less attention. In fact, in those countries that are at the early stages of the journey, improving function and productivity may be the most effective way to promote some important aspects of animal welfare. For example, alleviating pain is a useful entry point. Finally, it is important that the pace of the journey, in terms of public awareness and shifts in understanding, be supported by high-quality science that is rigorously assessed and validated in its practical application to the management of animal welfare.","Affective experiences; Animal protection; Animal welfare journey; Anti-cruelty; Biological functioning; Components of suffering; Positive welfare; Regulations"

Information theoretic methods are increasingly recognized as significant tools for the analysis of spike train data. However, developing robust implementations of these methods can be time-consuming, and determining applicability to neural recordings can require expertise. In order to facilitate more widespread adoption of these informative methods by the neuroscience community, we have developed the Spike Train Analysis Toolkit. STAToolkit is a software package which implements, documents, and guides application of several information-theoretic spike train analysis techniques, thus minimizing the effort needed to adopt and use them. This implementation behaves like a typical Matlab toolbox, but the underlying computations are coded in C for portability, optimized for efficiency, and interfaced with Matlab via the MEX framework. STAToolkit runs on any of three major platforms: Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. The toolkit reads input from files with an easy-to-generate text-based, platform-independent format. STAToolkit, including full documentation and test cases, is freely available open source via http://neuroanalysis.org, maintained as a resource for the computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics communities.

These changes can also be seen in the area of human resource management and support for decisions on key future spending on the remuneration of future employees. The article presents an original spatial data enrichment and spatial data mining methodology used for the analysis of primary data based on a sample of 1149 young candidates from generation Z to measure the effectiveness of data mining learning methods. The studies used data collected directly from surveys that were “enriched” with spatial geolocation. The fact that the spatial context was taken into account in the studies made it possible to develop a model explaining the spatio-temporal differentiation of professional expectations of respondents from generation Z who were studying professions connected with broadly understood IT. The analyzes used modeling with linear polynomial regression, the neural network of a multi-layer perceptron type and the multivariate adaptive regression splines method in the variant with and without spatial data filtration. The use of different spatial data mining methods made it possible to compare the reliability of models of knowledge extraction from the data and to explain the significance of individual factors which affected the respondents' beliefs. The analysis shows that spatial filtering of the data generates twice lower mean squared error while effective application of machine learning methods requires the use of explanatory spatial data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial neutral networks; Geolocalization; Human resources; Modeling; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Spatial data mining"

The proposed system is firstly considered for application in the tourism industry because of its HR intensive characteristics. The aim is to relate different categories of adults in various ways based on their performance at work and previous educational experience, to their Individual Learning Capability (ILC). This is carried out in a set of experimental tests using specialized neuroscience equipment. In this way cognitive attributes can be mapped for targeted occupational categories. This will enable HR managers in the industry to easily identify the learning capabilities of their workforce and therefore create an effective plan for human capital development. The proposed system makes use of a specialized device developed by the authors, which has the capability of making field measurements. This is a novelty that makes the experiment possible with less costs without sacrificing the data quality. Previously such data could only be obtained at very specialized laboratory conditions. With the proposed ILC evaluation system we can bring the real talents of people in the forefront and support them in building the necessary capabilities to be effective. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","HR Development; Human Resource Management; Learning capability; Learning Technology; Neuroscience"

First, a shift of focus to increasingly complex and heterogeneous neural network models, with a concomitant increase in the level of collaboration within the field (whether direct or in the form of building on top of existing tools and results). Second, a general trend in science toward more open communication, both internally, with other potential scientific collaborators, and externally, with the wider public. This multi-faceted development toward more integrative approaches and more intense communication within and outside of the field poses major new challenges for modelers, as currently there is a severe lack of tools to help with automatic communication and sharing of all aspects of a simulation workflow to the rest of the community. To address this important gap in the current computational modeling software infrastructure, here we introduce Arkheia. Arkheia is a web-based open science platform for computational models in systems neuroscience. It provides an automatic, interactive, graphical presentation of simulation results, experimental protocols, and interactive exploration of parameter searches, in a web browser-based application. Arkheia is focused on automatic presentation of these resources with minimal manual input from users. Arkheia is written in a modular fashion with a focus on future development of the platform. The platform is designed in an open manner, with a clearly defined and separated API for database access, so that any project can write its own backend translating its data into the Arkheia database format. Arkheia is not a centralized platform, but allows any user (or group of users) to set up their own repository, either for public access by the general population, or locally for internal use. Overall, Arkheia provides users with an automatic means to communicate information about not only their models but also individual simulation results and the entire experimental context in an approachable graphical manner, thus facilitating the user’s ability to collaborate in the field and outreach to a wider audience. © 2018 Antolík and Davison.","Computational modeling; Neuroscience; Publish; Tool; Workflow"

We introduce a novel, growing database which links administrative claims and medical records from an MS patient management system, allowing for the complete capture of patient profiles. Using the AOK PLUS sickness fund and the Multiple Sclerosis Documentation System MSDS3D from the Center of Clinical Neuroscience (ZKN) in Germany, a linked MS-specific database was developed (MSDS-AOK PLUS). Patients treated at ZKN and insured by AOK PLUS were recruited and asked for informed consent. For linkage, insurance IDs were mapped to registry IDs. After the deletion of insurance IDs, an anonymized dataset was provided to a university-affiliate, IPAM e.V., for further research applications. The dataset combines a complete record of patient diagnoses, treatment, healthcare resource use, and costs (AOK PLUS), with detailed clinical parameters including functional performance and patient-reported outcomes (MSDS3D). The dataset currently captures 500 patients; however, is actively expanding. To demonstrate its potential, we present a use case describing characteristics, treatment, resource use, and costs of a patient subsample. By linking administrative claims to clinical information in medical charts, the novel MSDS-AOK PLUS database can increase the quality and scope of real-world studies in MS. © 2023 by the authors.","administrative claims; electronic medical records; linked database; multiple sclerosis; real-world evidence"

We are living in the time of greatest dissemination of information in the history of the human race, and this excess of information has resulted in considering human attention as a scarce resource. Information overload is the situation in which the amount or intensity of information exceeds the individual’s limited capacity for cognitive processing. Objective. To describe the concept of information overload, its possible neurocognitive substrates, associated symptoms, causes, measures to avoid it, as well as its possible relationship with the internet and electronic devices. Development. People respond differently to information overload, and this depends on individual factors as well as on the amount and characteristics of the informative stimulation. Some symptoms of information overload are: inefficient work, confusion, delay in making decisions, lack of critical evaluation of information, loss of control over information, refusal to receive communication, lack of general perspective, greater tolerance for error, anxiety, stress, etc. The limits of information processing capacity are probably conditioned by the limited metabolic energy that is distributed in the brain and remains constant regardless of the difficulty of the tasks. Conclusion. Attention is a limited cognitive function. In order to reduce the adverse effects of information overload, it is necessary to improve the personal management of our own cognitive resources and to understand their relationship with technology. Likewise, it is necessary to improve the handling of information through the organization, filtering and application of cognitive ergonomics design guidelines. © 2021 Revista de Neurología.","Attention; Attention economy; Cognitive ergonomics; Cognitive load; Cognitive neuroscience; Memory"

These resources will be of increasing value for understanding the brain. Developing a database system to integrate these disparate resources is necessary to make full use of these resources. This study proposes a base database system termed XooNIps that utilizes the content management system called XOOPS. XooNIps is designed for developing databases in different research fields through customization of the option menu. In a XooNIps-based database, digital resources are stored according to their respective categories, e.g., research articles, experimental data, mathematical models, stimulations, each associated with their related metadata. Several types of user authorization are supported for secure operations. In addition to the directory and keyword searches within a certain database, XooNIps searches simultaneously across other XooNIps-based databases on the Internet. Reviewing systems for user registration and for data submission are incorporated to impose quality control. Furthermore, XOOPS modules containing news, forums schedules, blogs and other information can be combined to enhance XooNIps functionality. These features provide better scalability, extensibility, and customizability to the general neuroinformatics community. The application of this system to data, models, and other information related to human pupils is described here. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the purpose of this paper is to focus on new global research that combines intuition, trust and analytics in terms of how well C-level executives trust their intuition. Design/methodology/approach: Our Fulbright research, as described in this paper and performed by colleagues from the United States, Canada, Poland and Italy, examines executives’ as well as other less experienced employees’ preferences for different types of intuition versus data analysis. This study set out to better understand the degree to which executives prefer intuition versus analysis and the relationship between these approaches to decision-making. Our research combines elements of a review, a cross-cultural/cross-company survey study and a biometrics study in interoception. The research team has a multidisciplinary background in business, information technology, strategy, trust management, statistics and neuroscience. Findings: Based on our research, the main findings are as follows. The use of and preference for intuition types change as employees gain more experience. However, there may be intuition styles that are more static and trait-like, which are linked to roles, differentiating managers from leaders. Using “inferential intuition” and “seeing the big picture” go hand in hand. Listening to your body signals can promote improved intuition. Cross-cultural differences may impact executive decision-making. Executives often prefer to use their intuition over analysis/analytics. Research limitations/implications: This research could be expanded to have a larger sample size of C-level executives. We had 172 responses with 65% C-level executives and 12% directors. However, a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit on intuition used by executives had a sample of 174 executives around the world, which is comparable with our sample size. Practical implications: From our research, executives should continue to apply their experiential learning through intuition to complement their use of data in making strategic decisions. We have often discounted the use of intuition in executive decision-making, but our research highlights the importance of making it a critical part of the executive decision-making process. Originality/value: Based on the results of our survey and biometrics research, executives apply their intuition to gain greater confidence in their decision-making. Listening to their body signals can also improve their intuitive executive awareness. This complements their use of data and analytics when making executive decisions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Applied knowledge management; Innovation; Leadership"

As regards leadership training and assessment methods, they could be optimized using methodologies and techniques from organisational neuroscience (ON), which uses implicit measures of brain activity to gain a better understanding of the disciplines of organizing behavior and human resource management. One of the challenges of the ON is how to create complex social situations in controlled laboratory conditions that produce ecological organizational behaviors. One way is to use digital learning environments to reproduce problems that can occur in performance-based assessments. Extended reality technology (XR) scenarios can offer significant assessment playgrounds, providing students with situations that require the application of various skills. XR is increasingly used to reproduce natural events and social interaction. The advantage of XR is that it offers interactive, sensory, and multimodal stimuli. In this chapter, we will examine the latest developments in XR technology and organizational sciences. In it, we emphasize that XR is a very important tool for leadership research in particular to assess and train complex skills. This can create a new conceptualization of leadership biomarkers, called extended reality-based behavioral biomarkers (XRBBs), which can be obtained for the evaluation of leadership skills using a neuroscientific organizational paradigm based on implicit brain processes measured through psychophysiological signals and the behavior of subjects exposed to complex social conditions replication using virtual reality interfaces. © 2022 Scrivener Publishing LLC.","Leadership; Virtual reality; VR-based behavioral biomarkers"
